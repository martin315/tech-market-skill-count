      "description": "Who we are\n\n\n\n\nAbout Stripe\n\n\n\n\nStripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Team\n\n\n\n\nStripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.\n\n\n\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\n\n\n\nAs a company, we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.\n\n\n\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\n\n\n * Work on cross-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers\n * Give meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs\n * Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users\n * Build the skills to own a project from beginning to end, learning project management and technical leadership skills\n\n\n\n\nWho you are\n\n\n\n\nWe’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.\n\n\n\n\nMinimum Requirements\n\n\n\n\n * A Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD degree in computer science or a directly related field, obtained by summer 2024, or equivalent work experience\n * Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present\n * Experience from either previous internships or working collaboratively on multi-person coding projects (in a university or professional setting)\n * Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts\n\n\n\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n\n\n\n\n * One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request\n * Experience in code review practices, and an understanding of how to safely update production systems\n * Familiarity with navigating and managing work in large code bases",

      "description": "Starling is the UK’s first and leading digital bank on a mission to fix banking! Our vision is fast technology, fair service, and honest values. All at the tap of a phone, all the time.\n\n\n\n\nWe are about giving customers a new way to spend, save and manage their money while taking better care of the planet which has seen us become a multi-award winning bank that now employs over 2800 across five offices in London, Cardiff, Dublin, Southampton, and Manchester. Our journey started in 2014, and since then we have surpassed 3.5 million accounts (and four account types!) with 350,000 business customers. We are a fully licensed UK bank but at the heart, we are a tech first company, enabling our platform to deliver brilliant products.\n\n\n\n\nOur technologists are at the very heart of Starling and enjoy working in a fast-paced environment that is all about building things, creating new stuff, and disruptive technology that keeps us on the cutting edge of fintech. We operate a flat structure to empower you to make decisions regardless of what your primary responsibilities may be, innovation and collaboration will be at the core of everything you do. Help is never far away in our open culture, you will find support in your team and from across the business, we are in this together!\n\n\n\n\nThe way to thrive and shine within Starling is to be a self-driven individual and be able to take full ownership of everything around you: From building things, designing, and discovering to sharing knowledge with your colleagues and making sure all processes are efficient and productive to deliver the best possible results for our customers. Our purpose is underpinned by five Starling values: Listen, Keep It Simple, Do The Right Thing, Own It, and Aim For Greatness.\n\n\n\n\nHybrid Working\n\n\n\n\nWe have a Hybrid approach to working here at Starling - our preference is that you're located within a commutable distance of one of our offices so that we're able to interact and collaborate in person. We don't like to mandate how much you visit the office and work from home, that's to be agreed upon between you and your manager.\n\n\n\n\nOur Engineering Environment\n\n\n\n\nStarling engineers are excited about helping us deliver new features, regardless of what their primary tech stack may be. Hear from the team in our latest blogs or our case studies with Women in Tech.\n\n\n\n\nWe are looking for engineers at all levels to join the team. We value people being engaged and caring about customers, caring about the code they write and the contribution they make to Starling. People with a broad ability to apply themselves to a multitude of problems and challenges, who can work across teams do great things here at Starling, to continue changing banking for good.\n\n\n\n\nWe have built our entire banking platform in house and mostly in Java. We are looking for people who want to work on building the tooling that is used by our engineers on a daily basis.\n\n\n\n\nOur mobile engineers work in cross-functional feature teams arranged across broader engineering groups, and as an Android engineer you’ll be working in at least one of such teams. You are empowered to make the decisions necessary for the platform and to provide insight to the team leads on such projects. You’ll also be working closely with other Android engineers with a variety of experience levels and interests, helping us improve and develop our Android app, CI automations and tooling. You’ll be committing, reviewing and shipping new code right from the first week! 🎉\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nAs an Android engineer, you’ll report to and catch-up regularly with a mobile lead engineer who will support you on your journey in Starling. We have a strong collaborative and open culture here so you’ll find support outside your team too.\n\n\n\n\nAs a fully digital bank, we are looking for engineers that are able to understand and prioritise security when implementing new features, fixing bugs or making technical improvements, across all the layers. Our team is designing, building and releasing new screens every day, for this reason we are interested in people with a particular focus on Accessibility along with writing clean and maintainable code.\n\n\n\n\nThe way to thrive and shine within Starling is to be a self-driven individual and be able to take full ownership of everything around you: From building the code, shipping and maintaining it, to sharing knowledge with your colleagues and making sure all processes are efficient and productive to deliver the best possible results for our customers.\n\n\n\n\nOur aim is to deliver stable, resilient and high quality code, that is why testing is another key quality we look for when expanding our team. We use Espresso to write our UI/E2E Test and JUnit to write our Unit Tests across all layers of the application, as well as manually test all features before they go into production. We also work closely with QA engineers to ensure we have an additional level of testing when working on complex feature delivery.\n\n\n\n\nThe Android world\n\n\n\n\nIn the Starling Android application we are proud to be working with some of the latest technologies in the industry. When adopting new technologies we always consider as a team whether it’s the best choice for our product and our users.\n\n\n\n\nWe are currently in the process of modularizing our codebase, right now we have 10 feature modules and 10 library modules, plus one app module. The majority of our codebase is written in Kotlin as well as any new code that we write. We use MVVM to structure our presentation layer and RxJava throughout the whole application stack for handling asynchronous operations. We use Dagger as our dependency injection framework and Realm is our choice for persistence.\n\n\n\n\nWe want our app to look great for the Android platform and have worked closely with our designers to set up a component library and have themed our app accordingly. Feature parity is important to us so Android and iOS apps are often built alongside each other.\n\n\n\n\nWe release app updates at least once a week, and the role of release manager is rotated equally throughout the Android team. We’ve worked to automate as much of the release as we can, with our own internal tooling allowing us to standardise our release steps from uploading to the app stores to receiving approvals for safer rollouts.\n\n\n\n\nAs a team we meet together every week to talk through pain points and potential improvements we’ll like to make to the project. We regularly meet in real life to attend conferences and meet-ups together too!\n\n\n\n\nInterview process\n\n\n\n\nInterviewing is a two way process and we want you to have the time and opportunity to get to know us, as much as we are getting to know you! Our interviews are conversational and we want to get the best from you, so come with questions and be curious. In general you can expect the below, following a chat with one of our Talent Team:\n\n\n\n\n * Initial phone call: ~45 minutes\n * Take home technical test (no time limit)\n * Technical face to face: ~1.5 hours\n * Final Interview: ~45 minutes\n\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\n\n\n * 25 days holiday (plus take your public holiday allowance whenever works best for you)\n * An extra day’s holiday for your birthday\n * Annual leave is increased with length of service, and you can choose to buy or sell up to five extra days off!\n * 16 hours paid volunteering time a year\n * Salary sacrifice, company enhanced pension scheme\n * Private Medical Insurance with VHI\n * Generous family-friendly policies\n * Perkbox membership giving access to retail discounts, a wellness platform for physical and mental health, and weekly free and boosted perks\n * Access to initiatives like Cycle to Work and Salary Sacrificed Gym partnerships\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us:\n\n\n\n\nYou may be put off applying for a role because you don't tick every box. Forget that! While we can’t accommodate every flexible working request, we're always open to discussion. So, if you're excited about working with us, but aren’t sure if you're 100% there yet, get in touch anyway.\n\n\n\n\nWe’re on a mission to radically reshape banking – and that starts with our brilliant team. Whatever came before, we’re proud to bring together people of all backgrounds and experiences who love working together to solve problems.\n\n\n\n\nStarling Bank is an equal opportunity employer, and we’re proud of our ongoing efforts to foster diversity & inclusion in the workplace. Individuals seeking employment at Starling Bank are considered without regard to race, religion, national origin, age, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, marital status, medical condition, ancestry, physical or mental disability, military or veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.\n\n\n\n\nBy submitting your application, you agree that Starling Bank may collect your personal data for recruiting and related purposes.
