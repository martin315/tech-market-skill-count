We are inspired by the transformation that happened in the sports sector. Forty years ago, very few people sported. Today, many people dedicate several hours a week to sport. We would like to bring a similar change to the cultural sector. Our goal is to encourage people who love culture to engage in cultural activities on a weekly basis. For example, we want to encourage people that love cinema and rock concerts to go every week to the cinema and once a month to a rock concert.\n\n\n\n\nWHAT DO WE DO?\n\n\n\n\nWe work on a combination of three products: ClapApp, CultureToday, and CultureCab.\n\n\n\n\nClapApp - Personal assistant for your cultural life\n\n\n\n\nEvery city needs an app that allows you to see all the cultural activities available. It should work like Deliveroo, Uber eats, etc. You should be able to browse the cultural agenda of your city, buy tickets, and schedule events together with friends.\n\n\n\n\nThe app will need to have a database with all the cultural activities. There are two approaches to getting that database. We have an army of people copy/pasting all cultural activities into the database or automating the process.\n\n\n\n\nClapApp will be your assistant when it comes to your cultural life. It will alert you when there is a new movie from your favorite director or a new concert from your favorite band.\n\n\n\n\nCultureToday - Marketing Digital Assistant\n\n\n\n\nOnline marketing is growing bigger and bigger. All cultural organizations could use a marketing assistant. The assistant could automatically create presentations with the marketing results, automatically create campaigns and write monthly reports to be sent by email.\n\n\n\n\nThis full-stack project allows you to work with data, APIs, VUE, etc.\n\n\n\n\nCultureCab - CMS for culture\n\n\n\n\nCultureCab is our internal name for an adaptation of a Python/React CMS (Volto) that we use to create websites for cultural organizations.\n\n\n\n\nYOUR JOB\n\n\n\n\nAre you interested in working on a high-impact and short-term project to positively impact thousands of people?

We are looking for a full stack software engineer that can help us grow and maintain our web platform.\n\nYour role\n\nAs a full stack engineer, you will be working in cycles of six weeks, crafting and developing the solutions to our customer's problems, in an environment with a high level of autonomy. You will be responsible for developing features and improvements from planning to production.\n\nOur web platform's backend is written in Node.js and we use the Express web framework connected to a MongoDB database. We run on AWS, connecting our services through message queues. Our frontend is written in Angular following our style-guide along with a components library we are still developing. We write all our code in Typescript and ES6.\n\nYou'll be part of a cohesive team, pushing for getting the best results and sharing your experiences. You'll be writing highly tested JSON APIs and top notch database queries to support the frontend components you'll be creating, as well as developing our internal libraries and frameworks. We learn from each other, so you'll also do pull request reviews and provide technical mentorship to expand the team's knowledge.\n\nIt will be your and your team’s responsibility to ensure we are able to adapt to new circumstances to take every opportunity we have in order to achieve organizational goals. For that, you’ll need to build processes and tooling that will ensure a rapid development cycle that allows experimentation, learning, and changing courses based on the knowledge acquired. All of this needs to happen without compromising quality.\n\nWe love writing good software and believe in continuous learning. That means you will get time to expand your knowledge and to build a cool side project. You will be able to attend conferences, play around on different learning platforms and to get whatever you need to help you grow. Plus you'll join our company trips twice a year which are already a legendary tradition.\n\nYour profile\n\nWe are looking for experienced full stack engineers passionate in web technologies who feel comfortable designing and writing Javascript code from end to end, from the backend to the frontend.\n\nWe are fervent believers in design, so you should be able to design service interfaces and data structures even before coding the endpoint path.\n\nManagers of one thrive at Fashion Cloud. We're eager learners, laugh a lot, we are kind to each other, look up to each other and support each other. We are colleagues, here to grow together.\n\nWe value people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree.

If you are unfamiliar with some of these technologies that is ok, there is plenty of room to learn.\n   \n   \n\nWhy? 🤔\n\nDeeploy is a start-up with ambition. We try to solve one of the biggest challenges in AI nowadays: making AI/ML truly accountable.\n\nHow? 🚀\n\nWe do this by creating state of the art MLOps software for AI developers focussed on giving them the best experience possible.\n\nAt Deeploy we like a technical challenge. The beautiful thing is that we are in unexplored territory. So we have to be creative, invest in research and work with our end-users. This way we try to make the best choices possible for our users.\n\nYou don’t have to do this on your own. We like to work in dedicated and multidisciplinary teams where all team members can have their own speciality. Ranging from design, QA, architecture and security.\n\nWe always strive for quality and perfection, at Deeploy this is a continuous learning process that happens during development. With progressive insights, we adjust goals and approaches when necessary making ourselves and the product better.\n\nThis all makes no sense when nobody knows that we are doing all this awesome work. So knowledge sharing is an important part of what we do. As an engineer, this means that you can actively contribute by writing technical blogs, speaking at events, etc.. Next to giving something back to the community, this is also a good opportunity for some personal development.\n\nMost important of all, we love to be part of a team.

Examples of research questions that come to mind are the following, though we encourage you to introduce your own:\n\n * Do interactive / conversational explainers improve human feedback?\n * What is a generic way to improve / correct models based on human feedback (by incremental learning)\n * What would be the best architecture improvements to deploy models from a central platform to an edge device? (e.g. Raspberry Pi).\n * What is the most secure way to package Machine Learning models for Edge ML deployments? (e.g., Web Assembly, .wasm)\n   \n   \n\nDrop us a message for the latest topics\n\nWhat to expect from us: ⚡️\n\nWe look for people that want to enjoy the ride of a start-up and benefit from the freedom in the role:\n\n * We like to share and celebrate the small and big milestones that we reach in our common goals.\n * A job when your studies are over for the majority of our interns\n   \n   \n\nHave we spiked your interest? 🌎\n\nLet’s have a talk! In the first meeting you talk directly with one of the recruitment team, so ask everything you want to know. If you want to reach out to us before applying with any questions, drop us an email at jobs@deeploy.ml\n\nHow we proceed after the first talk: 📞\n\nBecause we think finding and hiring team members is one of the most important things we need to do right as a company, we designed a simple process so you know exactly how we proceed. We like to be quick, and typically complete our interview process within 2 weeks.\n\n * Step 1: Apply for the job and give us a good impression of yourself. Next to a LinkedIn/CV, we are even more interested in personal projects that you are proud of.\n * Step 2: You’ll have a quick 15-minute introduction call to one of the recruitment team, typically this will be let you know about all the great stuff we’re working on, prepare you for the rounds, and answer any questions you may have. Furthermore, we’ll find out a bit more about you on this call.\n * Step 3: We invite you for another meeting, preferably with 2 team members with who you are likely to work together with in your job. This time we give you a nice coding challenge. Depending on the situation we ask you to prepare the challenge before the meeting. Or even better, we invite you to solve the challenge in our office so you can get a grasp of the Deeploy atmosphere as well. We value your time, so we timebox the challenge to a maximum of 3 hours. Remember, experience is a nice bonus, but we mainly look at your engineering potential and team fit.\n * Step 4: We make an offer and welcome you aboard! 🎉",

Our mission is to transform how organizations handle and work together on sensitive data. With a diverse team of cryptographers, developers and strategy experts, we work passionately to drive innovation and positive change for customers across health care, public sector and energy.\n\n\n\n\nOur product: The Virtual Data Lake (VDL) software enables parties to perform joint data analyses without exposing the underlying data. We differentiate with uncompromising privacy, rapid deployment, and accessible software -so that our customers can focus on generating insights and value from the data.\n\n\n\n\nOur culture: Integrity and honesty is central to all we do as a team. We are obsessed with quality, open to feedback and eager to learn. We celebrate diversity and accommodate for individual preferences. Where, how, and when you work is up to you.\n\n\n\n\nThe Role\n\n\n\n\nThe core of our Virtual Data Lake uses techniques from modern cryptography to enable unique privacy features. However, the core would be worthless without an intuitive client-facing application – and that’s where you come in! You will play a pivotal role in designing and developing new features in our customer-facing applications as well as designing and building efficient back-ends and smart API-layers in-between. This is an all-round engineering position, meaning that the challenges you solve will engage your front- and back-end development skills, as well as your UI-design skills.\n\n\n\n\nYour responsibilities include:\n\n\n\n\n * Designing web app architecture and the user interactions;\n * Developing back-ends and middleware, including RESTful APIs and documentation;\n * Creating database models and designing how this data is presented to the user;\n * Developing our web apps with a focus on cross-platform and responsiveness;\n * Close cooperation with the cryptography and customer deployment teams;\n * Design, develop and implement application solutions that make our products more intuitive and more effective for our users, while not compromising on the strong security and privacy guarantees;\n * Working in sprints with an agile methodology in close alignment with the scrum team and the product owners;\n * Proactively identify opportunities and solutions for improvement of the application code;\n * Design friendly and intuitive UI and APIs (customers typically work in healthcare, law enforcement, energy, cyber security).\n\n\n\n\nWe are looking for a colleague who can identify with the following description:\n\n\n\n\n * University degree (MSc) in a field that is relevant for the description below, with a curious, creative, and analytical mindset;\n * Experience in projects that involve databases and algorithms, but also well-versed with user-facing technologies;\n * The ability to translate requirements and mockups into fully functioning web-applications, taking care of both the front- and back-end;\n * Strong proficiency in web development with experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages. Experience in front-end frameworks such as Angular, Vue or React;\n * Experience in designing and building RESTful APIs, especially in Python;\n * Prior experience in designing UI/UX is a plus;\n * Hands-on experience with deploying on Linux environments is a plus (being comfortable on the command line);\n * You have an international orientation and experience. You speak English at a professional level;\n * You are hands-on, proactive, organized, and structured. You have a strong eye for quality;\n * You are creative and not afraid to step outside of your comfort zone. You can quickly respond to changes in the environment and deliver short-cyclical value in an Agile way;\n * You enjoy working in a small team of a fast-growing start-up with many opportunities but also many uncertainties.\n\n\n\n\nWe offer attractive employment conditions that suit a start-up in this phase; participation is an option. We value a high-performance culture built around our core values: customer, quality, and team. Where, how, and when you work is up to you.\n\n\n\n\nApplying for this role\n\n\n\n\n * Currently, this position is open for candidates with an EU work permit that are based in The Netherlands or are willing to move there;\n * When applying for this role, please include links that highlight your relevant experience, such as GitHub, Stack Overflow, or portfolio websites;\n\n\n\n\nDoes this sound like your dream job but you don’t tick all the boxes?

      "description": "Summary\n\n\n\n\nJust imagine: starting work every morning with a wide smile, with a curious and inclusive bunch of 22 engineers. You are helping to build a solid backend and add cool features. You are hands-on coding in PHP, familiar with Laravel, used to working with databases (MySQL, ElasticSearch and Redis) and external API's. Imagine, as well, having all of your hard work see the light of day and have impact: all the features we work on are getting deployed to production in an instant and shipped to around 38,000 users.\n\n\n\n\nAt Trengo, we believe in a world where technology empowers the relationship between companies and their customers. That’s why our mission is to build the smartest customer engagement platform to replace repetitive work with meaningful conversations. How do we do that? Our software makes it easy for customer-facing teams to communicate with customers via multiple channels, all in one shared inbox. Email, Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, live-chat, you name it. With a Series A investment of $36M led by Insight Partners and Peak Capital and becoming one of the four official WhatsApp Business Solutions Providers in the Netherlands, we empower our customers to scale their businesses and optimize the channels their clients truly prefer.\n\n\n\n\nHave a look at our documentation for different Trengo integrations, like the website widget, REST APIs, sidebar apps, custom channels and Flowbots: https://developers.trengo.com/ . You are also welcome to create a free trial account and have a peek at Trengo.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Your Day Looks Like\n\n\n\n\nLet's break down this big vision into a little taste of your work at Trengo:\n\n\n\n\n * It might be refreshing for you to know that building new features in Laravel is what takes most, if not all of our time. And we don't plan to stop innovating any time soon. We are fast to send features to production and ship them- this is always after peer review. We collaborate a lot. We are all for the team spirit. You can see that in our jokes and memes too, but that's another story :-).\n * We like to think of these features as MVP's: design them, build them including unit tests, ship them and then see what value they add to the market. It is rewarding to read the feedback from the customers who beta test them and to share our wins with the whole team.\n\n\n\n\nFYI, our frontend code is written in Javascript with Vue.js . There’s no harm if you like a bit of that as well!\n\n\n\n\nWhat We Expect From You\n\n\n\n\nNow that you know a bit about us, can you tell me a bit about you? I hope you can identify with some of these:\n\n\n\n\n * You've seen some stuff: you have been in the middle of the action when a digital/tech-focused company scaled up.\n * You are used to work with external APIs. We mostly integrate messaging API's, E-commerce and CRM software.\n * You’re not only using external APIs, so will shape the Trengo APIs as well.\n * You enjoy coding in PHP, within the Laravel framework. If you are already familiar with it, then we have no major surprises for you, because we follow the Laravel best practices.\n * You write your own tests, you are used to TDD, both unit and integration tests.\n * You are able to work independently and stand behind your own decisions (not in a hierarchical way, but rather in a critical/constructive way).\n * You are just as helpful and collaborative as us. We have a good thing going on in our tech team and would like a kind person to join us.\n\n\n\n\nWhat We Offer\n\n\n\n\nThis is what we carefully prepared for you:\n\n\n\n\n * Finding yourself in a fast-growing company where your career can evolve. With the help of your number one supporter, your manager, you will follow our departmental growth tracks to pursue the career you want. This is one of the reasons for our positive Glassdoor reviews (4.3/5).\n * We really value flexibility and trust our people. That’s why we work hybrid, and our people can work from abroad for 60 days per year.\n * Free sessions with on-demand psychologists from OpenUp . Your mental health is important to us.\n * An education budget of €1000 to feed your curiosity, extra budget for team trainings, and 2 extra days off for your courses or conferences, if needed.\n * 28 vacation days to rest, have fun, and travel as you wish. But, every once in a while, we also like to do it together. The last time, we went on an amazing trip to Valencia !\n * Weekly Yoga and Bootcamp classes in our office to blow some steam off after work with the guidance from a certified trainer!\n * Fancy learning Dutch? We also offer Dutch courses for our international employees!\n * When you work from our beautiful office : you can bet we have delicious warm lunches together prepared by our in-house chef and workplace experience team. Also, your traveling expenses to Utrecht will be reimbursed.\n\n\n\n\nYour Recruitment Experience At Trengo\n\n\n\n\nWe aim for our recruitment experience to be fast, enjoyable, and fruitful - for both sides. Via this link , you can see what you can expect from your recruitment journey with us.\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise don’t worry, we understand if you don’t know what to do right now. You like what you read but you still have questions before deciding to move forward. We got you! I am Evangelos , your friendly recruiter and part of Trengo’s Talent Team. Happy to clarify any doubts, so you can make a good choice, whichever that is. If you are not ready to apply yet, feel free to ask a question in the Flowbot. If you are ready, talk to you soon.",

      "description": "Over de rol\n\nIn een wereld vol informatie is heldere informatie koning. Met information design maken we complexe materie op een visuele manier begrijpelijk. Hier kan jij als developer aan bijdragen door samen met het team de ontwerpen van de designers tot leven te laten komen en creaties voor onze klanten te creëren. Je denkt actief mee over werkbare concepten, gebruiksvriendelijkheid en geeft vanaf de conceptfase input op wat wel en niet werkt voor interactieve producties. Ook ben jij verantwoordelijk voor de werking en onderhoud van de websites. Dat je dit nog niet helemaal tot in de puntjes beheerst vinden wij alleen maar leuk, wij nemen je namelijk graag mee in de wereld van design, informatie en development.\n\nWat betekent dit concreet\n\n * Jij gaat werken aan producten zoals: dashboards & tools, microsites & scrollstories, interactieve datavisualisaties & interactieve merkervaringen.\n * Samen met onze creatieven bedenk jij originele, creatieve en interactieve oplossingen voor onze klanten. Denk hierbij aan het tot leven brengen van micro-animaties tot aan het creëren van websites waarvoor jij samen met je collega’s de interactie van het UX/UI design verzorgt.\n * Jij hebt de verantwoordelijkheid voor het uitwerken van ontwerpen tot een werkende productie, veelal op basis van web-technologieën.\n * Jij draagt zorg voor de werking en het onderhoud van onze websites. Je houdt o.a. de server veilig, zorgt dat de code pakketten up to date zijn en de website goed draait om zo te zorgen dat de klant haar website tot het maximale kan benutten.\n * Jij brengt de functionele en technische randvoorwaarden voor creatieve producties in kaart en adviseert de teams hierover.\n * Jouw enthousiasme voor nieuwe technologieën zet jij je in voor het bedenken van nieuwe features en werkt deze uit voor onze websites. Hierdoor zorg je dat de performance van deze websites continu verbetert.\n   \n\nWat breng jij mee?\n\n * Enthousiasme om te werken aan verschillende projecten voor steeds wisselende klanten, maar wel altijd met een team van Clarify’ers die allemaal een andere discipline beheersen. Een steile leercurve is gegarandeerd!\n * Je kan HTML, CSS en JavaScript dromen (of we helpen je daar te komen)\n * Je wordt er blij van om UX/UI designs tot leven te wekken. Je krijgt er energie van om met behulp van subtiele animaties de UI nóg soepeler te laten werken, of voor nét dat beetje extra verwondering te zorgen.\n * Je hebt ervaring met Git en weet hoe je je code modulair organiseert in incheckt in de repository.\n * Je hebt ervaring met React en Next.js voor websites gebaseerd op een headless CMS.\n * Je kan ook je weg vinden in klassieke Wordpress Sites die met PHP en MySQL zijn gebouwd.\n * Naast het zijn van een (to be) goede coder, ben je analytisch sterk en snap jij de (on)mogelijkheden van techniek. Je kan hier al best een mening over vormen en vindt het dan ook leuk om mee te denken over de inhoud en gebruiksvriendelijkheid van producties.\n * Dit wordt niet jouw eerste keer richting een kantoor en je hebt daarom in ieder geval één tot drie jaar officiële werkervaring. Officieus vinden wij het natuurlijk helemaal top als jij in de afgelopen jaren al eens een website in elkaar hebt geknutseld of gewoon alles digital wil begrijpen.\n * Jouw hoogste doel is uiteraard dat onze klanten blij zijn, daarom mis je geen deadline en ben je zelfs liever iets eerder klaar met je opdracht. Onze klanten zijn je eeuwig dankbaar.\n * We werken veel voor Nederlandse klanten, dus als je de Nederlandse taal beheerst is dat fijn maar geen vereiste. Spreek je alleen Engels, dan is dat ook helemaal goed\n   \n\nWat kan je van ons verwachten?\n\n * Een goed salaris op basis van relevante ervaring en eigentijdse secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden (waaronder 26 vrije dagen, pensioenopbouw en een jaarlijkse bureaureis).\n * De vrijheid om je rol in te vullen op de manier die het beste bij jou en je interesses past. Als je maar op vrijdagmiddag mee doet met een potje tafeltennis\n * Een dynamische omgeving, met aandacht voor persoonlijke en professionele ontwikkeling.\n * Een kantoor met informele sfeer op een mooie locatie in de Houthavens van Amsterdam.\n   \n\nOver Clarify\n\nBij Clarify geloven we dat duidelijkheid je verder brengt. Wij maken complexe materie van onze klanten begrijpelijk. We werken op het snijvlak van design, consultancy en techniek. Met infographics, explanimations, interactieve tools en visual consultancy. Information design noemen we dat.\n\nComplexiteit is overal. We werken dan ook voor veel verschillende opdrachtgevers – van start-ups tot de overheid en alles wat daartussen zit. Dit doen we al sinds 2003 met Booreiland, in60seconds en Getting the picture. Vanaf 2022 zijn we samen Clarify en hebben we een duidelijke missie: complexe informatie vertalen naar kraakheldere verhalen.\n\nSolliciteer\n\nWil jij ons team komen versterken?

So we’ve created an orchestrator that lets multiplayer developers host their game sessions automatically.\n\n\n\n\nNow, we need a software engineer to help us evolve, improve, and refine our platform. Someone who knows their way around code, while also coming up with ideas for the future.\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nWho you are\n\n\n\n\nOur ideal recruit is someone who lives and breathes programming, but also knows how to put the end result to the test. An expert who knows the best practices and has the communication skills to explain them to the rest of us. Someone who isn’t afraid to raise concerns and speak their mind.\n\n\n\n\nWhile experience in the gaming sector is a bonus, it’s not essential. It’s far more important that you’re a relaxed person, not a corporate robot. You’ll also be pretty good at managing your own time: choosing how your own day looks, setting your own deadlines, and keeping to them.\n\n\n\n\nWhat will you be doing?\n\n\n\n\n * Coding and testing\n * Creating our testing processes and writing documentation\n * Figuring out how testing fits into our flow\n * Working on our orchestrator’s micro services\n * Testing automation, integration and units\n * Answering tickets and working on features\n * Tinkering with our infrastructure\n * Dabbling in DevOps\n * Contributing to meetings: Discussing and helping us make a better product and deciding the roadmap together\n\n\n\n\nWhat Will Make You Stand Out\n\n\n\n\n * You’ve been coding and testing for about four or five years or more\n * You’ve got mostly professional experience, plus any experience through hobby work\n * You know the difference between a micro-service and a monolith\n * You know the difference between white box and black box testing\n * You know Docker inside out and dream of Kubernetes\n * You’re very familiar with GitOps\n * You know TypeScript and NodeJS. Statically typed languages like Rust, Go, and C/C++ are a bonus\n * You’re self-driven, motivated and proactive – someone who’ll work toward a target, not just tick off boxes\n\n\n\n\nBear in mind, we won’t rule you out just because you’re missing one or two things from the list. Although, the more you have, the better you’re likely to fit.\n\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\n\n\n * Work wherever you like: We’re 100% remote. While our company was established in the Netherlands, we have no physical HQ. Your office is wherever you choose it to be\n * Pick your work hours: We’d love to see you during our core hours (9am to 5pm Amsterdam time) and you’ll need to come to our daily meetings. But, apart from those, you can fit your work around your life (not the other way around)\n * We’ll sort your station: Keyboard worse for wear? No problem. Put in a request, and we’ll get you a brand-new one. We’ll make sure you have the tools you need\n * Coffee is on us: Staying cooped up indoors isn’t healthy. So we’ll give you a daily budget to go out each day\n\n\n\n\nOne of our core values is that we’re completely agnostic. So we want to work with the best people, regardless of your background. If that sounds like you, we want to see your resume.",

      "description": "We're on the lookout for a new skilled Back-End Python/Django Developer to join the NextGear team. We are growing incredibly fast and are in need for some extra hands to keep up the momentum. That's where you come in!\n\nYour role\n\nIn short; we're looking for a backender who can help us improve our platform. After an intense period, where the main goal was to launch as quickly as possible, we are now keen on improving the platform. This applies as much to the UI as it does for anything behind the scenes. We always have to keep an eye on security and reliability due to the amount of money that is processed via the platform, while also keeping an eye on usability and performance, since we receive up to 10k backend requests per minute, a number that keeps going up.\n\nGive me some details…\n\nAt the moment our focus is on gradually replacing a frontend written in Django by a React-based frontend. This is why the last people to join us in 2022 were both frontenders.\n\nThe new frontend will allow us to scale up further. It connects to an API that we are adding to the existing Django project, after which we’ll remove the existing frontend code from the Django project. Meanwhile, we’re writing new functionality in plain Django, which may be moved to React later on. The rewrite also offers us the opportunity to reflect on, and improve, on the current design and usability.\n\nYour activities will consist of;\n\n * Working on new features for existing project components\n * Being responsible for native Django views (model/view/template) and/or admin\n * REST framework endpoints\n * Interfacing with existing APIs for payment providers and other 3rd parties\n * Writing (new) microservices (plain Python or Flask)\n * Doing data science stuff\n * Reviewing merge requests\n * Refactoring and writings tests\n * CI config\n * …honestly there’s a lot we want to do, we’re full of plans and ideas\n   \n   \n\nYour profile\n\nIdeally you’d have a skillset like this:\n\n * Experience with Python/Django (we try to follow PEP8)\n * Knowledge of common design patterns\n * This would make you stand out: you have experience with projects running on AWS (e.g. S3 implementation or Rekognition usage)\n   \n   \n\nWhat we really need:\n\n * An experienced programmer\n * Being able to think outside the box of your own tasks\n   \n   \n\nDon’t fuss about:\n\n * Not knowing Django when you have experience with Python\n * Only feeling fit for some of the activities we mention\n   \n   \n\nWhat we offer\n\n * Competitive salary, paid holidays, benefits package and 13th month\n * Collaborative and friendly work environment\n * Hybrid working with at least one day at the office\n * Possible travel expenses will be compensated\n * Flexible work schedule\n * Free lunch and drinks at the office\n * Work trips (upcoming one is to Bucharest with the entire team)\n   \n   \n\nAbout NextGear\n\nNextGear was founded back in 2003. For more than 20 years, NextGear has been building impactful digital solutions for versatile clients from different industries, ranging from the Aviation industry to Finance and Social Communities. We're proud to have a team of highly motivated and young tech enthusiasts between 20 and 40 who work on everything from design and front end to backend and infrastructure. We have a healthy mix of external clients and in-house project. Our exciting new platform, launched last year, has exceeded all our expectations, and now we need to grow our team to help us take it to the next level.\n\nWhere?\n\nWe're a hybrid-remote team that values flexibility. Our goal is to see each other at least once a week, because we feel that helps to stay in tune. Other than that, you can work from home or from our office located in the heart of Amsterdam. We're a diverse group of people who love to work hard and play even harder. We offer a Dutch lunch - or Surinamese food on the first Monday of every month, and we have an excellent espresso machine for coffee lovers (but don't worry, we have tea too). We're also a safe, open, and transparent community, and we have the occasional furry friend in the office.\n\n&Work will help you\n\nNextGear has partnered with &Work. &Work understands that it is important to work in a place where you are valued, where you can develop further and where you are given the space to grow. By applying via &Work, you get direct access to their broad network of employers. &Work can help you with the introduction atNextGear, provide background information, prepare you for interviews so that you can present yourself convincingly and assist you during the negotiations to help you take a nice step forward in your career.",

      "description": "Benieuwd naar nieuwe ontwikkelingen? Houden innovaties jou bezig? Altijd al willen weten welke technieken er achter de apps, websites en software zit die je dagelijks gebruikt?\n\nOntdek de wereld van Software Engineering bij Educom in Utrecht en leer in 12 maanden een specialistisch vak door op een hoog en professioneel (abstractie)niveau concepten te begrijpen en toe te passen in innovatieve mobiele, webbased en desktop (applicatie) oplossingen.\n\nFunctieomschrijving\n\nOp zoek naar een nieuwe uitdaging, momenteel geen job, net afgestudeerd of oriënterend op de arbeidsmarkt? Maak kennis met ons en kom erachter hoe Educom haar traineeship samen met jou op maat vormgeeft. Combineer ons specialisme met jouw enthousiasme! Zet een e- voor jouw carrière en beleef software. e-ducom maakt het mogelijk!\n\nFunctieprofiel\n\nIn 40 jaar heeft Educom een Proof of Concept (POC) ontwikkeld. Met jarenlange vakkennis vanuit inhoud, door 2.000 ervaringen met zowel kandidaten als opdrachtgevers en met het opbouwen van een groot netwerk, is ons concept geëvolueerd en heeft zich ontplooid tot een modulair traineeship.\n\nOnze aanpak is uniek, doordat het volledig afhankelijk is van jouw (inhoudelijke en persoonlijke) ontwikkeling. Het (gezamenlijke) doel is om het maximale uit je kwaliteiten te halen. Het is onmogelijk om vooraf te weten wie je bent, hoever de mogelijkheden van jouw kwaliteiten reiken, welke opdrachtgever goed bij je past en of je kunt voldoen aan de verwachtingen.\n\nOp eigen rekening en risico investeren wij in de vakopleiding van programmeren. De essentie is om het vak te begrijpen. Afhankelijk van je ontwikkeling (leercurve), bereiken we een diepgang die we matchen met onze opdrachtgevers. Hiermee managen we de verwachtingen, voor alle partijen. Op persoonlijk vlak maken alle partijen gezamenlijk een duurzame keuze. Zo kun je jaren werkervaring opdoen en je verder ontwikkelen in de praktijk.\n\nDe eerste fase van ons traineeship bestaat uit Essentials® waarbij je fundamentele concepten, vak-interpretatie, structuren, verbanden, gelaagdheid en patronen leert begrijpen op een hoog conceptueel en abstractieniveau. Hierbij gaat het om (diepgaande) taal- en platformonafhankelijke kennis van programmeren als vak. We leren je hoe je met de tools uit software stacks omgaat. Dit is geen trucje, maar begrip. “Use the tool, don’t be a tool.”\n\nDe tweede fase bestaat uit Elaborations® waarbij differentiatie plaatsvindt in toepassingsgebieden van de geleerde concepten, zoals closed-source (proprietary software) omgevingen (Microsoft .NET), open-source omgevingen (Java), webomgevingen (PHP) of juist een specialisatie als front-end development (React, Angular, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3), mobile development (Xamarin, React Native) of UX/UI, IxD design. Verdieping op layer-niveau of juist full-stack.\n\nProgrammeren is een vak dat door onze praktijkdocenten/-coaches in gestructureerde vorm aangeleerd wordt. Het vak leer je in het programmeerparadigma van Objectgeoriënteerd programmeren (OOP). Het paradigma is de mindset, de oplossing is leidend en de (programmeer-, script-) talen als PHP, Java, C#(.NET), JavaScript en Python zijn de uitvoering. In toepassingen leer je onder andere werken in opensource software-ontwikkelomgevingen en in geïntegreerde software-ontwikkelomgevingen (IDE’s) als (Microsoft) Visual Studio, NetBeans of Eclipse. Hierbij leer je werken met design patterns als MVC, MVVM, MVP en Observer pattern op (multi-, cross- of onafhankelijke) platformen/frameworks als .NET, ASP.NET, Symfony, Laravel, React, Spring, jQuery en Angular. Aan de hand van softwareontwikkelmethodes als Agile (Scrum) en Test Driven Development (TDD) leer je samenwerken en omgaan met versiebeheersystemen als Git en Subversion.\n\nWij vragen\n\nWanneer jij;\n\n\n * beschikt over een HBO- of Academische opleiding of aantoonbaar niveau; je wordt getoetst en geanalyseerd op aanleg, dus een (gerichte) vooropleiding is niet vereist;\n * intrinsiek gemotiveerd en geïnteresseerd bent om het vak programmeren te leren en/of in de eindeloze mogelijkheden van het multidisciplinaire vakgebied van Software Engineering;\n * de diverse fasen van een software(ontwikkel)proces wilt ontdekken vanuit diverse rollen als developer, analist, architect, designer, tester en consultant;\n * gefascineerd raakt door de oneindige mogelijkheden van de techniek;\n * graag meegaat met technologische trends en bereid bent continu te investeren in kennis;\n * bereid bent te investeren in jezelf en jouw carrière;\n * fulltime inzetbaar bent en mobiliteitsbereid (maximaal één uur enkele reisafstand); we werken local-for-local en naar verwachting wordt er steeds meer thuisgewerkt;\n * beschikt over goede communicatieve en sociale vaardigheden;\n * bereid bent onvoorwaardelijk onze waarden en normen te representeren;\n * (exclusief) geselecteerd wordt als 1 van de 25 kandidaten die we per jaar per vestiging opleiden.\n   \n   \n\nWij bieden\n\nBieden wij;\n\n\n * een kwalitatieve, zware vakopleiding door praktijkgerichte vakdocenten (liefkozend vakidioten genoemd) en hiermee de mogelijkheid om een vak (ambacht) aan te leren;\n * gegarandeerd een baan en werkervaring als junior Software Engineer;\n * persoonlijke én inhoudelijke matching;\n * professionele en persoonlijke begeleiding, waarbij we de verwachtingen managen en afstemmen met jouw leercurve, om succesvol je eerste stappen op de arbeidsmarkt te zetten als junior Software Engineer;\n * de ideale arbeidsomstandigheden (omgeving/klimaat) en voorwaarden (salariëring) om jouw carrière zowel professioneel als persoonlijk maximaal te ontplooien;\n * persoonlijke coaching door een specialist vanaf het eerste contactmoment, indien van toepassing of wenselijk; onder meer geleiding vanuit een werkende situatie, gesprekken over financiële en/of sociale stabiliteit, vrijstelling van sollicitatieplicht (als een uitkeringssituatie (WW of WWB) van toepassing is);\n * toegang tot onze vakkennis (inhoud, netwerk en ervaring) en kennisdatabank;\n * faciliterende zaken (onder andere werkplek, studiemateriaal en certificeringen);\n * tot slot, onze bedrijfscultuur; maak kennis met ons warme karakter met zuidelijke invloeden en kom de échte Limburgse vlaai proeven.\n   \n   \n\nOver Educom\n\nEducom is sinds 1981 actief in de wereld van Software Engineering en gespecialiseerd in het ontwikkelen van potentie van mensen. We vormen mensen educatief (inhoudelijk en persoonlijk) en stellen ze in staat om zich te ontwikkelen, waarbij we ze leren abstractie concreet te maken en multidisciplinair toe te passen als junior Software Engineers.\n\nEducom positioneert zich tussen educatieve uitstroom en arbeidsmarktinstroom en profileert haar vakkennis binnen een branche die gekenmerkt wordt door de complexiteit, ontwikkelsnelheid en het hoge abstractieniveau van de productiefactor kennis. Als ervaren dienstverlener ondersteunen we in kennisvraagstukken gericht op innovatie, (software)migratie en kennismanagement die onder invloed van de huidige digitale revolutie exponentieel zijn toegenomen bij organisaties, waardoor er inmiddels continu sprake is van een kennisachterstand of –tekort (capaciteit).\n\nMet vestigingen in Sittard, Eindhoven, Utrecht en Arnhem speelt Educom aanbodgestuurd in op de ontwikkelingen in de markt. Tot nu toe hebben we in 40 jaar met ruim 2.000 mensen hun eerste stappen in de Software Engineering gezet met een slagingspercentage van ruim 95%. Kwaliteit is leidend en persoonlijke ontwikkeling staat centraal.\n\nHoe nu verder?\n\nBen jij geinteresseerd in bovenstaand profiel voor Software Development Traineeship?

We provide biologists with the software, machine learning & services to discover, design and optimise enzymes and their cell-factories to ultimately produce almost anything.\n * We're an experienced team. We have built many successful products before and we have raised enough funds to have plenty of runway for the years to come!\n * We're focused on building the best possible team culture. We're distributed across two locations, and are flexible about when and where we work.\n * We offer top of the market salary, a generous equity stake in the company and a wide range of benefits from health and wellbeing, financial, to training and career progression opportunities.\n   \n   \n\nThis is Cradle\n\nCradle helps teams to engineer proteins with fewer, more successful experiments. We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. We are bridge builders who bring together the best of machine learning, synthetic biology, developer tools, and user experience design. Our mission is to enable a world where most of the products around us can be easily made and degraded biologically using a cell-factory instead of (petro-)chemicals, plants or animal agriculture.\n\nIn software we have an almost infinite degree of freedom on designing solutions. We at Cradle want to use this flexibility to provide a new level of experience for biological engineers. These engineers work on optimising proteins (sequences of amino acids), which currently includes a lot of expert knowledge and manual steps. We want to revolutionise their processes and build a ‘photoshop for proteins’ supported by machine learning. On that mission we deal with complex user objectives, diverse data structures and physical lab interactions while offering an easy to use, low code user interface.\n\nWhat we are looking for\n\nFor this challenge we are looking for backend software engineers who are excited to peek out of the virtual world and join us on designing a platform for optimizing biological systems. Be ready to witness first hand what happens when you leave the bits and bytes behind and try to solve challenges with nature’s constraints and complexity.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nAs a backend software engineer, you will be responsible to:\n\n * Develop a decoupled, service oriented platform application powered by sophisticated machine learning tools\n * Support the team in establishing a stable, high quality and flexible software engineering process\n * Collaborate with biologists, machine learning experts and scientists alike and learn to understand their domain\n   \n   \n\nNeed to haves\n\n * Strong algorithmic and problem solving skills\n * You have proven track record of developing back-end systems in a modern cloud environment.\n * You have excellent knowledge of software development best practices, including code reviews, version control, and CI/CD pipelines.\n * You write readable code. Cradle aims to build a team of excellent computer scientists which includes advanced coding skills. We are set but not fixed on coding in Python at the moment.\n * You are able to communicate well. We are working at the intersection of biology and software where good communication is key.\n * You are kind and work well in teams. We look for team players who contribute to a positive and friendly working environment.\n   \n   \n\nNice to haves\n\n * Extensive knowledge of the Python programming language and its ecosystem.\n * A solid understanding of application development lifecycle, testing principles, and agile practices.\n * You have worked with databases or big data systems.\n * You have been working on production systems for machine learning applications.\n * Experience in building containerized backend systems using Docker and Kubernetes.\n   \n   \n\nCradle helps biologists design improved proteins in record time using powerful prediction algorithms and AI design suggestions.\n\nWe use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. Our mission is to ultimately help more people build with biology and replacing traditional farms and factories for a more sustainable world.\n\nYou will be joining a high-growth, highly ambitious startup with an experienced founding team, whose motivation is building a more sustainable world using biology. We are backed by some of the most well known investors and industry veterans. Joining us now means you will be getting in on the ground floor; you will have a significant impact on how we shape the company, and success will mean an outsized reward.\n\nDid we pique your interest?

We are specialized in developing digital strategies for cultural organizations.\n\n\n\n\nWe work with museums, theaters, film houses, castles, libraries, festivals, etc. Some of the cultural organizations we work with are: Guggenheim Museum, Stadsschouwburg Utrecht, Film Theater Hilversum, Loevestein Castle, Library Utrecht, Le Guess Who festival, etc.\n\n\n\n\nOur mission is to change how people relate to culture. We are inspired by the transformation that happened in the sports sector. Forty years ago, very few people sported. Today, many people dedicate several hours a week to sport. We would like to bring a similar change to the cultural sector. Our goal is to encourage people who love culture to engage in cultural activities on a weekly basis. For example, we want to encourage people that love cinema and rock concerts to go every week to the cinema and once a month to a rock concert.\n\n\n\n\nWe are a young team of international professionals. You will be assigned high responsibility tasks from day one. Every Monday, we analyze the success of the previous week and plan the upcoming. We have lunch together every day. On Fridays, the entire team joins for drinks as we stop working half an hour earlier.\n\n\n\n\nTasks\n\n\n\n\nWe work on a combination of three products: ClapApp, CultureToday, and CultureCab.\n\n\n\n\nClapApp - Personal assistant for your cultural life\n\n\n\n\nEvery city needs an app that allows you to see all the cultural activities available. It should work like Deliveroo, Uber eats, etc. You should be able to browse the cultural agenda of your city, buy tickets, and schedule events together with friends.\n\n\n\n\nThe app will need to have a database with all the cultural activities. There are two approaches to getting that database. We have an army of people copy/pasting all cultural activities into the database or automating the process.\n\n\n\n\nClapApp will be your assistant when it comes to your cultural life. It will alert you when there is a new movie from your favorite director or a new concert from your favorite band.\n\n\n\n\nCultureToday - Marketing Digital Assistant\n\n\n\n\nOnline marketing is growing bigger and bigger. All cultural organizations could use a marketing assistant. The assistant could automatically create presentations with the marketing results, automatically create campaigns and write monthly reports to be sent by email.\n\n\n\n\nThis full-stack project allows you to work with data, APIs, VUE, etc.\n\n\n\n\nCultureCab - CMS for culture\n\n\n\n\nCultureCab is our internal name for an adaptation of a Python/React CMS (Volto) that we use to create websites for cultural organizations. Check out some of the work we have done:\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nAre you interested in working on a high-impact and short-term project to positively impact thousands of people? Are you passionate about creating software that stretches the limits of technology and beauty? If so, we have the perfect job opportunity for you.\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your expertise and experience, we will together find the right fit and topic which could be Web-development (ReactJS, Angular, Python, Plone, Volto), data analysis (Google Apps Script, Google Sheets, Data Studio), or another topic you want to propose.",

We have built many successful products before and we have raised enough funds to have plenty of runway for the years to come!\n * We're focused on building the best possible team culture. We're distributed across two locations, and are flexible about when and where we work.\n * We offer top of the market salary, a generous equity stake in the company and a wide range of benefits from health and wellbeing, financial, to training and career progression opportunities.\n   \n   \n\nThis is Cradle\n\nCradle helps teams to engineer proteins with fewer, more successful experiments. We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. We are bridge builders who bring together the best of machine learning, synthetic biology, developer tools, and user experience design. Our mission is to enable a world where most of the products around us can be easily made and degraded biologically using a cell-factory instead of (petro-)chemicals, plants or animal agriculture.\n\nIn software we have an almost infinite degree of freedom on designing solutions. We at Cradle want to use this flexibility to provide a new level of experience for biological engineers. These engineers work on optimising proteins (sequences of amino acids), which currently includes a lot of expert knowledge and manual steps. We want to revolutionise their processes and build a ‘photoshop for proteins’ supported by machine learning. On that mission we deal with complex user objectives, diverse data structures and physical lab interactions while offering an easy to use, low code user interface.\n\nWhat we are looking for\n\nFor this challenge we are looking for full stack software engineers who are excited to peek out of the virtual world and join us on designing a platform for optimizing biological systems. Be ready to witness first hand what happens when you leave the bits and bytes behind and try to solve challenges with nature’s constraints and complexity.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nAs a full stack software engineer, you would be responsible to:\n\n * Develop a decoupled, service oriented platform application powered by sophisticated machine learning tools\n * Implement lightweight and modularized web-based user interfaces and visualizations\n * Support the team in establishing a stable, high quality and flexible software engineering process\n * Collaborate with biologists, machine learning experts and scientists alike and learn to understand their domain\n * Work in a cloud native runtime environment using Google Cloud, Kubernetes, helm, docker et al.\n * Integrate a variety of existing tools for biological processes in the Cradle ecosystem\n   \n   \n\nNeed to haves\n\n * Strong algorithmic and problem solving skills\n * You enjoy designing software systems. We are in an early stage of the company where you will majorly contribute to the software design of the product.\n * You are excited about all parts of the software stack which is reflected in your past projects. At any given day you could be asked to extend a web server API, contribute to a codon optimizer*, or even implement a UI plugin.\n * You are interested and excited about learning a new domain. You will be faced with a lot of new concepts and enjoy learning diverse topics.\n * You have excellent knowledge of software development best practices, including code reviews, version control, and CI/CD pipelines.\n * You are able to communicate well. We are working at the intersection of biology and software where good communication is key.\n * You write readable code. Cradle aims to build a team of excellent computer scientists which includes advanced coding skills. We are set but not fixed on coding in Python at the moment.\n * You are kind and work well both independently and in teams. We look for team players who contribute to a positive and friendly working environment.\n * Do a little research online if you don’t know what this is :)\n   \n   \n\nNice to haves\n\n * Extensive knowledge of the Python programming language and its ecosystem.\n * A solid understanding of application development lifecycle, testing principles, and agile practices.\n * You have worked with databases or big data systems.\n * You have designed user interfaces and are familiar with one or more of the popular frameworks.\n * You have been working on production systems for machine learning applications.\n * Experience in building containerized backend systems using Docker and Kubernetes.\n   \n   \n\nCradle helps biologists design improved proteins in record time using powerful prediction algorithms and AI design suggestions.\n\nWe use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. Our mission is to ultimately help more people build with biology and replacing traditional farms and factories for a more sustainable world.\n\nYou will be joining a high-growth, highly ambitious startup with an experienced founding team, whose motivation is building a more sustainable world using biology. We are backed by some of the most well known investors and industry veterans. Joining us now means you will be getting in on the ground floor; you will have a significant impact on how we shape the company, and success will mean an outsized reward.\n\nDid we pique your interest?

      "description": "About Pagoda\n\n\n\n\nPagoda is shepherding a future where NEAR becomes the blockchain operating system. We believe that re-inventing how software is made and distributed is our greatest opportunity to open economic access to those who are not fully integrated into the global economy. Our products empower people to find opportunity, invent new experiences, and collaborate. Let's build an Open Web world. A world where people control their assets, data, and power of governance.\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Role\n\n\n\n\nThe Protocol Engineering team at Pagoda is responsible for the infrastructure of the Layer 1 Blockchain, NEAR Protocol. We focus on building a scalable, performant, and reliable infrastructure to actualize visions of NEAR Protocol, including the Blockchain Operating System (BOS).\n\n\n\n\nThe core component of NEAR is a WebAssembly virtual machine that runs in a completely trustless and fully deterministic mode, as it executes contracts implemented in WebAssembly-friendly languages (e.g. Rust and Javascript) using a fast compiler. NEAR contributes a lot of effort into performance and safety optimizations of WebAssembly VMs/compilers which helps not only the NEAR protocol but the entire WebAssembly ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\nWe are looking for an Engineer with experience in low-level programming who is intrigued by a variety of open problems inherent to running compilers in completely trustless but high-performance settings, and who likes contributing to and collaborating with open-source communities.\n\n\n\n\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\n\n\n\nIn this role, you will be solving cutting-edge compiler and VM problems related to safe, deterministic, and high-performance compilation and execution. You will interface with many open-source projects where you might be asked to represent the NEAR organization. In the future, your work might also extend beyond WebAssembly VMs into other types of VMs that NEAR chooses to support. You'll work on a collaborative and globally distributed team of world class experienced engineers, providing an opportunity to learn and grow your technical skill set.\n\n\n\n\nWhat We're Looking For\n\n\n\n\n * Knowledge and experience using Rust, C, or C++ in a production environment. We can teach you Rust if you are already a C or C++ expert\n * Familiarity with low-level programming (compilers, operating systems, hypervisors, etc)\n * Experience designing, maintaining, and debugging distributed systems built with open source tools\n * Solid foundation with Algorithms and Data Structures and their real world use cases\n * Demonstrated success working on a globally distributed team\n * Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or related fields is a must\n\n\n\n\nWe'd Love If You Have\n\n\n\n\n * Contributions to open-source software\n * Experience with Rust API design\n * Experience with virtual machines\n\n\n\n\nHere's What Our Interview Process Looks Like\n\n\n\n\nOur interviews take place via Zoom and typically consists of the following stages:\n\n\n\n\n * Internal Recruiter Call (30 to 45 minutes)\n * Meet with the Hiring Manager (30-45 minutes)\n * Technical Interviews (4 x 60 minutes)\n * Pagoda Values Interview (30 to 45 minutes)\n\n\n\n\nBenefits & Perks\n\n\n\n\n * Flexible Annual Leave / PTO with an encouraged 20 day per year minimum\n * Paid Holiday Week: the last week of the year\n * Paid Wellness Week: the first week of July\n * $2,000 Yearly Continued Education Reimbursement\n * $2,000 Home Office Setup Reimbursement\n * Co-working Space Reimbursement\n * Company Retreats (2023 in Spain!) & Team Offsites\n * Mental Health Support and access to licensed therapists through Spill, 100% paid by Pagoda\n\n\n\n\nOur Values at Pagoda\n\n\n\n\nOur values express our company culture.

Verder werken we met grote hoeveelheden data, daarom is databaseonderhoud ook een onderdeel van de werkzaamheden.\n * Om het opgeleverde werk te testen, is er een staging omgeving ingericht waar ruim 2.000 automatische testen worden gedraaid voordat er een 'go' op livegang komt.\n * Het development team is meestal op dinsdag en woensdag aanwezig op kantoor in Amsterdam, en werkt dus geregeld vanuit huis.\n * Ambitieus?

In Microsoft .NET bouw je nieuwe functionaliteiten en onderhoud je de bestaande.\n\nJouw rol\n\nJe hebt contact met verschillende stakeholders om in kaart te brengen wat de eisen zijn voor de functionaliteit. Op basis daarvan maak je een eerste ontwerp. Met het team van de klant werk je dit ontwerp vervolgens verder uit. Vaak werken jullie hierbij aan verschillende onderdelen, dus jullie houden elkaar regelmatig op de hoogte van de voortgang. Wanneer (een deel van) de functionaliteit klaar is, schrijf je een unit test die je ook zelf uitvoert. Nadat de functionaliteit ook meerdere malen getest is door een Tester, kun je deze deployen naar een plek waar de eindgebruikers de applicatie kunnen gebruiken. Hierna ben je ook verantwoordelijk voor het onderhoud en beheer van je functionaliteiten op de server. Dit beheer doe je in verschillende tools, waaronder Azure DevOps en SQL.\n\nJe werkt bij de klant op locatie; projecten duren meestal tussen de zes maanden en een jaar. Ook ben je ongeveer eens per week op kantoor bij ilionx, zodat je ideeën kunt\n\nuitwisselen en kunt bijpraten met de andere developers.\n\n''Als je nieuwsgierig bent en het leuk vindt om nauw samen te werken met je collega's en je hebt een uitdaging vindt dat je dag vaak anders loopt dan gepland, dan is dit een baan voor jou.''\n\nWie we zoeken\n\n * Hbo werk- en denkniveau\n * Minimaal 2 jaar relevante werkervaring\n * Kennis van / ervaring met .NET (Core), MVC, WebApi, JavaScript, SQL, HTML en CSS\n * Je deelt graag kennis met collega's en klanten, en bent op de hoogte van de laatste trends en opkomende technologieën\n * Goede beheersing van de Nederlandse taal\n   \n   \n\nWat we bieden\n\n * 32 tot 40-urige werkweek\n * 26 vakantiedagen\n * Mogelijkheid om (technisch) inhoudelijke trainingen te volgen\n * Maandelijkse bonus\n * Leaseauto\n   \n   \n\nWat doe je?\n\n * 50% functionaliteiten ontwikkelen\n * 20% overleg met collega's\n * 10% projecten plannen\n * 10% bug verhelpen\n * 10% functionaliteiten beheren en onderhouden\n   \n   \n\nOver ilionx\n\nOnze vestiging in Amsterdam bestaat uit meer dan 150 gedreven, ervaren, slimme en een tikkeltje eigenzinnige professionals die dagelijks gave projecten bij ons op kantoor of op locatie bij de klant uitvoeren.

Je kan direct inschatten of hiervoor een hotfix gedeployed moet worden of dat je eerst je huidige taak af maakt.\n\nTijdens het ontwikkelen denk je altijd van uit de gebruiker - \"Als Hendrik-Jan dit zou moeten instellen, zou hij dit dan kunnen vinden?\". Daarbij ben je altijd gedreven om nieuwe dingen te leren en kan je het direct vertalen naar iets technisch.\n\nMartijn stuurt je namelijk weer een mailtje over een nieuwe psychologische trigger wat er voor zorgt dat de bezoeker eerder zijn of haar e-mail adres achterlaat. \"Hoe zou dit code-technish werken? Oh! dat is eigenlijk best makkelijk om te bouwen!\".\n\nWij vragen\n\nJe kent de klappen van de javascriptzweep en hebt ervaring met Vue.js (!), Angular of React.\n\nJe hebt ervaring met het ontwikkelen van websites en CMS systemen.\n\nJouw kennis van HTML en (S)CSS is vanzelfsprekend perfect. Droom je het al?\n\nOpleiding genoten m.b.t. Marketing/ Communicatie/Multimedia/Informatiekunde\n\nJe kijkt altijd wat jij aan een situatie kan doen in plaats van de schuld bij iemand anders te zoeken.\n\nNiets zo fijn als op de fiets naar kantoor te kunnen, maar als je het niet erg vind om te dealen met de NS is dat ook oké\n\nGebruikersgemak? Jij weet precies hoe je tools inricht voor de beste UX\n\nWij bieden\n\nVergoeding Je krijgt een marktconform salaris op basis van jouw kennis en ervaring\n\nGroeipotentie Je salaris groeit mee met je verantwoordelijkheid. Er is geen salarisplafond (nee, ook niet van glas)\n\nVoeding Er staat een gevulde koelkast voor je klaar met de mogelijkheid om (gezond) te koken\n\nSport Elke maandag om 16;00 uur sporten we met het hele team. Zweten tot je erbij neervalt!\n\nAutonomie Je bent zelfstandig en bent vrij om jouw 'stukje van de business' naar een volgend niveau te tillen\n\nLegendarische trips Minstens 1x per jaar gaan we met z'n allen op reis.\n\nZomer en winterfeesten met +1 Want als je een partner hebt willen we die ook graag leren kennen.\n\nVrijheid Geen vast aantal vakantiedagen en geen vaste uren. Op basis van je verantwoordelijkheid maak je zelf je planning (i.o.m. je team).\n\nOntwikkeling Groei staat centraal bij de IMU. Wil je je ergens in ontwikkelen? Dan helpen en ondersteunen we je daarbij.\n\nVriendschap Alleen maar leuke mensen bij de IMU. Je vriendengroep is er niets bij!\n\nOver Internet Marketing Unie\n\nVanuit de IMU leren wij ondernemers hoe zij meer online resultaat kunnen behalen. We bloggen, maken video's, geven trainingen en verkopen onze eigen website software. De IMU is online groot en een bekende naam in de markt maar offline zijn wij met een compact, creatief en jong team (10 FTE tussen de 20 - 30 jaar).
