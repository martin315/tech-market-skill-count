We now take over 750,000 bookings every year, driving growth for our industry from the large-scale races like the UK’s London marathon, Great North Run and San Francisco’s Bay To Breakers ,or grassroots races like those from RunThrough.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve grown exponentially in the UK since our launch in 2017 and are now in the process of expanding within the US market with the same energy our brand represents. Our investors include Tier 1 VCs NFX, EQT, Y-Combinator and legendary individuals Serena Williams and Usain Bolt…\n\n\n\n\nHow did we do it?\n\n\n\n\nWith an exceptional team. The Let’s Do This team brings in experience ranging from London’s fastest growing start-ups to the world's biggest tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Deliveroo, King and Skyscanner.\n\n\n\n\nWe’re passionate about finding fantastic people to add to an already extraordinary group. Having been named as one of the UK’s top 15 startups in 2021 by LinkedIn, it couldn't be a more exciting time to join our team.\n\n\n\n\nThe Role\n\n\n\n\nAt Let’s Do This, our Software Engineers are an integral part of our product development process.\n\n\n\n\nWe are not a company that believes engineers should be hidden away from decisions, churning out code for features decided from upon high. Instead, our Engineers form strong bonds with cross-functional peers in Product Management, Data Science, Product Design and others to become experts working full stack across vertical slices of the product rather than horizontally along technology lines.\n\n\n\n\nAs a Software Engineer you’ll get to work with a range of new and emerging technology and tools but also help to evolve what we use in the future. We value engineering knowledge over specific coding languages, thus consider people from many backgrounds, but we are mainly TypeScript focused.\n\n\n\n\nOur current tech stack includes:\n\n\n\n\n * Node, AWS Lambda and Typescript to write our backend (micro)services\n * React, Apollo and BaseWeb to create engaging user interfaces\n * MongoDB for most persistent data storage & Amazon EventBridge for our async event bus\n * Docker and Amazon ECS to schedule and run our services.\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nWhat You'll Do\n\n\n\n\n * Every day you’ll be working closely with peers in the wider product org to define the future of the product\n * Engaging with designers to build and improve the UX of our core products\n * Working with our data scientists to design, run and verify your work using state of the art experimentation and feature flagging frameworks\n * Actively contributing to every stage in the product development lifecycle, and owning the development of new features from conception to completion\n * Shaping the future of our tech platform across the full stack\n * Working in a small, tight-knit team with a rapid iteration cycle - typically a week.\n\n\n\n\nWhat We Look For\n\n\n\n\n * Prior exposure to our stack (JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node & AWS) is a plus. However, we know the best engineers can pick up new tools quickly and a growth mindset coupled with strong fundamentals is more important than knowledge of specific frameworks or languages\n * You enjoy building products in cross-discipline teams using an iterative approach, driven by user feedback and data insight and care deeply about providing a great user experience to customers\n * You’re not afraid of ambiguity and thrive when helping set the direction of the team\n * You understand the importance of prioritisation in your work to ensure a good balance between business impact and code quality\n * You have interests that span the full stack - from building performant web experiences to debugging traffic latency in our AWS stack.\n\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\n\n\nWhat You'll Get From Us\n\n\n\n\n * A chance to work for one the fastest growing tech businesses in Europe\n * Stock options that incentivise everyone across the business (from co-founders to most recent joiners) to work together to build our organisation\n * A highly impactful role that will shape the future of a major global tech platform with huge learning potential, work variety and exposure to real-world problems\n * Collaboration focused business with teams harnessing knowledge from Deliveroo, Google, Facebook and many more hyper-tech/scale-up companies\n * Flexible hybrid working\n * 4 months fully paid paternity/maternity\n * Cycle to Work scheme\n * BUPA medical & dental cover\n * Significant discounted race entry\n\n\n\n\nWe want to create an inclusive environment that celebrates the diversity of our people whilst enabling them to do the best work of their careers.

      "description": "About Metomic\n\n\n\n\nOver the last ten years, SaaS has changed the way we work — for the better. Slack instead of email. Miro instead of sticky notes. Airtable instead of Excel. SaaS is helping tech companies move so much faster, but it’s also introducing a new surface area of risk they’ve never seen before. The risk of leaking sensitive data. As a result, companies are faced with answering the difficult question of how to manage compounding security risks as they grow without introducing more red tape that slows their team down.\n\n\n\n\nAt Metomic, we help companies protect sensitive data in SaaS applications like Slack, Google Drive and Zendesk.\n\n\n\n\nOur technology connects to SaaS applications, detects the most critical sensitive data risks, and put automated policies in place to ensure these risks don’t happen again in the future.This liberates tech companies to make full use of their favourite SaaS apps whilst Metomic takes care of all the security risks behind the scenes.\n\n\n\n\nAfter launching our product in April 2021, we now count some of the world’s most innovative companies as customers, such as Zego, Octopus Energy and Crypto.com. In 2023 we raised a $20m Series A round led by Evolution Equity and backed by other investors such Connect (investors in CityMapper, Typeform, Marvel), LocalGlobe (Improbable, Figma, Zego) and RFC (Hopin, Clubhouse, On Deck, etc), and Resonance.vc.\n\n\n\n\nEngineering Team\n\n\n\n\nAs we continue to change the way companies deal with their sensitive data, our Engineering Team (currently 8 strong) is growing and we’re looking to welcome Software Engineers, either back-end or full-stack, to our team to be part of this journey.\n\n\n\n\nSome of the areas you may be working on: Our sensitive data and classification engine, building systems to allow us to process billions of messages a day, data ingest pipelines, sensitive data remediation system, risk identification and ranking engines and alerting systems.\n\n\n\n\nOur back-end services are written in Typescript and make extensive use of Kafka, GraphQL and Postgres. Our front-end is written in React/TypeScript. Our house style is grounded in functional programming principles. We use AWS ECS Fargate via github actions and Terraform to deploy to production multiple times a day.\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\n * Product-minded and pragmatic engineers - Front of mind for you is thinking through what the best solution is for the problem the customer is facing. You’ll be given a lot of autonomy to explore solutions from what we build, how it’s designed and what technologies we use\n * Problem-solvers - We’re facing a lot of previously uncharted territory and with that a set of new and unseen challenges. You’re not one to shy away from tackling these sorts of problems. You’ll think through not just how to solve a problem, but what caused the problem in the first place and how we can make improvements to prevent similar problems in the future\n * One eye on now, one eye on what’s next - Our engineers have a passion for bringing to life distributed systems and scalable and robust architectures. You’ll have a huge role in coming up with how the system will evolve from an architecture and engineering standpoint\n * Culture contributors - We’re a small, close-knit team and recognise the importance of our culture as we continue to grow. You’ll be pivotal in helping shape the early stages and building a team platform that we can grow from\n\n\n\n\nWe encourage applications from all backgrounds, communities and industries and we are happy to discuss any reasonable adjustments that you require.\n\nAs an equal opportunity employer, we are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. Metomic does not discriminate based on age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion/belief, sex, sexual orientation. Every employment is based on qualification, excellence, and business need. Metomic is deeply committed to diversity, equity and inclusion both in our hiring practices and in our experiences as Metomic employees. We strive to create a mindful and respectful environment where everyone can bring their authentic self to work and experience a culture that is free of harassment and discrimination.\n\nBenefits\n\nLife as a Metonaut\n\n * Remote Working - We’re remote-friendly and also have an office in Shoreditch, London that you can work from at anytime\n * Our success is your success, so you’ll receive equity in Metomic (under our tax-efficient EMI options scheme)\n * Private Health Insurance - Enrolled from Day 1 through Vitality, for when life happens\n * Holiday Leave - 25 days holiday leave, excluding bank holidays\n * Learning Budget - £750 per year to invest in your growth\n * WFH Budget - £400 one-off contribution to your home office\n * Unforgettable events - Annual team trip away. We have recently been to Barcelona! (previous years have been a castle near Marseille, a penthouse in Lisbon, and a farm in South Downs, UK\n   \n   ",

By using the screens on their walls & the content in their systems we enable the sales, productivity & engagement that keep our customers’ businesses thriving.\n\n\n\n\nWe’re very proud of our product and we’re also incredibly proud of our people. It’s our ‘ScreenClouders’ and the culture they nurture that will take us where other companies just can’t go.\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll love working at ScreenCloud if you value transparency (join our monthly All Hands for business updates) flexibility (we’re one of Flexa’s Top Ten most flexible companies to work for) internationality (time zones don’t phase us) and integrity (join us, and you’ll also join our company-wide Share in Success scheme.)\n\n\n\n\nWe’re intentionally social. We think that spending time together is important… We think it’s so important that we arrange an annual company retreat, and we call it ScreenCloud Together! Each international hub regularly hosts visits from our teammates in other hubs. We balance regularly working from home with bright, well-designed office spaces - where we can see our own screens at play.\n\n\n\n\nThe Role\n\n\n\n\nWe are seeking a highly skilled and motivated Web Developer to join our Core Department, a critical team responsible for managing our marketing site and driving growth and performance marketing initiatives for our self-serve and non-ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) segments. As a Web Developer, you will play a pivotal role in enhancing our online presence, optimising user experiences, and driving business growth through innovative web development solutions.\n\n\n\n\nThis role offers the unique opportunity to collaborate closely with our development team in Belfast, ensuring a cohesive and streamlined approach to web development. The role is based in our London office, where you'll be at the heart of our innovative and exciting journey towards enhancing our online presence and driving business growth.\n\n\n\n\nOur ScreenCloud.com site is a NextJS app, which uses React for the frontend, but makes it easy to add backend functions as part of the same app when needed. It is written in TypeScript, and styled with SCSS. We use Github for version control, and deploy to Vercel for the best developer experience.\n\n\n\n\nJoin our dynamic team and significantly impact our company's growth and success. As a Web Developer in the Core Department, you will have the opportunity to bring your expertise and creativity to deliver exceptional web experiences that captivate our audience and drive business growth. Apply now and be part of an innovative and exciting journey!\n\n\n\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\n\n\n * Website Development: Collaborate with the Core Department team to design, develop, and maintain our marketing site, ensuring its functionality, responsiveness, and performance\n * Implement SEO best practices to optimise site visibility and improve organic search rankings\n * Create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces that provide an exceptional user experience\n * Leverage your expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other front-end technologies to enhance site aesthetics and interactivity\n * Work closely with the growth and performance marketing teams to implement tracking codes, conversion funnels, and A/B tests for effective campaign measurement\n * Optimise landing pages and web elements to maximise conversion rates and improve overall campaign performance\n * Understand our self-serve and non-ICP segments to tailor web experiences that align with their specific needs and preferences\n * Implement dynamic content and personalisation to deliver targeted messaging and offers\n * Partner with cross-functional teams, including designers, content creators, and marketing specialists, to align on project goals, streamline workflows, and deliver cohesive web experiences\n * Ensure seamless mobile responsiveness across different devices and platforms to effectively capture and retain mobile users\n * Implement security best practices to safeguard the website against potential vulnerabilities and data breaches.\n * Monitor website performance metrics and identify areas for improvement, such as page load times and overall site speed\n * Employ performance optimisation techniques to deliver a smooth browsing experience\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\n * Proven experience as a Web Developer, ideally with a focus on marketing sites and performance optimisation\n * Proficiency in front-end web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design principles\n * Experience working with React, NextJS, or another component based framework\n * Experience with content management systems (CMS) and website builders (e.g., WordPress, Wix)\n * Strong understanding of SEO best practices and the ability to implement them effectively\n * Familiarity with web analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel) and conversion tracking\n * Knowledge of performance marketing strategies and techniques to support campaign optimisation\n * Experience with version control systems (e.g., Git) for collaborative development\n * Excellent problem-solving skills and attention to detail\n * Ability to work independently as well as in a team-oriented, fast-paced environment\n * Strong communication skills, both written and verbal, to effectively collaborate with diverse teams\n\nInterview Process and Experience\n\n\n\n\nDon’t meet every single requirement? Studies have shown that women and people of colour are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every single qualification. At ScreenCloud, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace, so if you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyway. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles!\n\n\n\n\nHere’s some information about how we recruit at ScreenCloud. We have a commitment to engaging with diverse talent and creating a consistently positive candidate experience; in order to help us achieve these goals we regularly deliver internal interview training. We are also committed to objective assessments and want to provide a realistic preview for each of our roles, so we are likely to ask you to complete a (manageable, not onerous and always hypothetical) task or challenge as part of the process.\n\n\n\n\nIf you require any reasonable adjustments, please let our friendly recruitment team know. We understand everyone is busy, so we like to streamline our interview processes with a focus on quality over quantity . This means our interview processes will be challenging and enriching, and (unless there is a particular reason for additional conversations), at most you’ll be attending three interviews before we make a decision.\n\n\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\n\nAt ScreenCloud our values are core, this means they are the starting point - they underpin everything we do and enable a culture we can be proud of, internally and externally.\n\n\n\n\nTrust & Transparency\n\n\n\n\nTrust underpins high levels of autonomy for every ScreenClouder, we trust your opinion and we encourage you to use your initiative. We are trusted to work flexibly with the freedom to define the best ways to do our best work. We’re trusted to be honest, and in turn are trusted to handle the honest truth. We create transparency with care; our Leadership team is accessible and here for you. We’re on this journey together, and we promise to keep you informed.\n\n\n\n\nUnconventional & Brave\n\n\n\n\nOne size never fits all and we are not copy-cats. We are happiest when we’re challenging traditional approaches, finding new paths, creating new territory and setting the benchmark. We work hard to nurture an inclusive environment that welcomes new and varying perspectives. We use our judgement and we take risks, because we know that what’s unusual today might be normal tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\nIntegrity\n\n\n\n\nWe don’t compromise on integrity. We don’t avoid having real conversations and we won’t lie - to ourselves, to our customers, to our investors… to anybody! We want to build genuine, long-term relationships. We make decisions with the best interests of our colleagues and customers in mind.\n\n\n\n\nFlexibility & Inclusivity\n\n\n\n\nWe don't love CVs here at ScreenCloud. We appreciate that your resume isn't an effective representation of you, your experience, your approach, your opinions or your potential. Equally, this job advert can't do justice to what being in this role will feel like on a daily basis.\n\n\n\n\nWe encourage you to get in touch, even if you don't think you meet all of the criteria.\n\n\n\n\nAnd, if you need flexibility, we want to hear from you! If you'd love to find out more about this role, and you need to work ‘unusual’ hours, or you're looking for a part-time contract or have any potential individualised needs, we’re looking for people who can have positive impact… We're always open to talking about how we can enable that to happen.\n\n\n\n\nFIND OUT MORE\n\n\n\n\nCheck out our Bangkok, Belfast, LA and London hub pages.\n\n\n\n\nClick here for some podcasting with our co-founders.\n\n\n\n\nRead our culture blog here.\n\n\n\n\nGet social!

      "description": "We’re looking for a full-stack engineer to join our team. You'll be pragmatic, have a great product-mindset, keeping users at the heart of how you think, and have a passion for great UI and UX. You already have past experience of frontend development with React and are comfortable writing code that runs on the backend too.\n\n\n\n\nWe’re on a mission to empower independent businesses across the UK to offer the best deliveries on Earth, saving them time, money and stress, and making their customers the happiest they can be.\n\n\n\n\nWith the various surfaces our product touches, from merchants with the merchant dashboard, to consumers through our tracking page and drivers & operations with our routing & driver app, you’ll be able to have an impact on a wide range of users, and in areas where there is incredible potential to improve upon the industry status quo and delivery a truly wonderful experience.\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll be able to be flexible, switching between working on the frontend or the backend when needed even being excited for going out to do deliveries with a driver, visiting merchants, handling packages within the depot, and moving beyond ‘engineering’ when needed to to help the business and gain a first hand understanding of the problems you’re trying to help solve.\n\n\n\n\nAs an early engineer, this is a unique opportunity for you to help shape what we build, and the way we build it. There’s still so much to do and learn, in every aspect of Packfleet — we’re only just beginning our journey!\n\n\n\n\nWhat you’ll be doing day to day:\n\n\n\n\n * Building new features in our product that improve the lives of our merchants, recipients, drivers or our internal operations (or all of the above!)\n * Chatting with folks in the team about how we should build something, fix an interesting issue, or design a feature, whether they’re an engineer or a designer or operations manager\n * Improving our tooling or infrastructure as needed to make it easier for us to debug issues or scale as we have more users\n * Sharing your opinions on designs, goals, operational problems, hiring, etc. and giving feedback to others to help us do the best we can\n * Chatting with users to gather feedback or help them solve issues they’re having to improve our product for everyone\n * Occasionally getting hands-on, going out with drivers to do deliveries or handling packages in the depot, to get an end-to-end understanding of the problems we’re trying to solve\n * Getting the opportunity to input into other areas of the business that interest you, whether that’s helping on sales, refining our operations, or anything else\n\n\n\n\n🛠 Engineering at Packfleet\n\n\n\n\nFor our tech stack we’ve leaned on a combination of Rust where speed matters, and TypeScript where developer productivity is more important. We have a “well-sized services” approach which gives us flexibility to use the right language for the job, which unlike microservices the number of services grows slowly over time.\n\n\n\n\nFor our backend infrastructure we use Google Cloud Platform and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to orchestrate our services. We make use of code generation and type-safe, language-agnostic interfaces like protobuf and GraphQL as much as we can. Using continuous deployment running on Github Actions, we deploy our backend dozens of times per day.\n\n\n\n\nWe tend towards paying for tools or services as opposed to building them ourselves, if we can put money towards a problem that would otherwise take a lot of our time whilst still creating the user experience we desire than we’ll aim to do so. We’ll try to keep our investments in a few tools/services rather than having many ways to save the same problems, and are conscious of the number of innovation tokens we spend.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s good to know what to expect and a little about how we do things currently, but there’s plenty to improve and the mindset you bring is far more important than your familiarity with our tech stack or tools. So if you’re not so familiar with some of the tools or languages then don’t let that dissuade you, your way of thinking and experience is much more important.\n\n\n\n\n🏡 Logistics\n\n\n\n\nThis role is based at our office/depot in Bermondsey, London. We currently work in a hybrid set-up, where we aim to spend at least 2 days/week together in the office and working remotely the rest of the time, keeping us close to the drivers in the team and the physical elements of our business whilst also giving flexibility for remote working.\n\n\n\n\n💌 How to apply\n\n\n\n\nYou can apply here in just a few minutes, and if you have any questions or queries you’re welcome also to drop an email to jobs@packfleet.com as well. We are able to sponsor visas for this role.\n\n\n\n\n💛 Our commitment to diversity\n\n\n\n\nWe care deeply about creating a diverse team so we particularly encourage applications from people from different underrepresented demographics and encourage you, regardless of your background and past experience, to apply if the role excites you.\n\n\n\n\nIf we want to solve problems for people across the UK (and one day around the world), our team has to represent those we’re solving them for. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them.\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nYou should apply if:\n\n\n\n\n * You’re excited about what we’re doing! We’re a technology company working in a very traditional industry and that gives us a huge opportunity to build something truly different\n * You’re comfortable getting hands-on in a very early stage startup environment. We’re still a small team and so you’ll be involved in everything\n * You have experience building web apps in React, and are comfortable writing code that runs on the backend too — having experience with Typescript here is a plus\n * You care about the users we are creating products for, being happy to speak to them directly, and love turning designs into beautiful products\n * You are comfortable in the face of ambiguity and are happy to take on problems without a clear definition or solution\n * You are comfortable putting something out there when it’s not-perfectly-polished to gather feedback, whether that’s an MVP of a feature, a draft of a proposal, or your thoughts on a design\n * You care about the team and culture we are building, and understand the importance of giving feedback and supporting others around you\n\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\n\n\nWhat you’ll get:\n\n\n\n\n * A competitive internally-transparent salary and stock options in Packfleet, with the choice to trade-off salary for additional stock options on signing. The range for this role, based on level/seniority and salary trade-off, is £60,000 - £110,000 alongside meaningful equity\n * Experience at an early stage startup, with a team that’s taken companies from zero-to-one before\n * A close knit working environment where everybody is working in the same direction, with regular monthly socials\n * A company & culture that cares about the people within it, with benefits like health insurance, mental health days-off, a learning budget, internally-transparent salaries and 35 days holiday (inc. bank holidays) with top-ups & unpaid holiday if you need more\n * Our Community Day on the last Monday of every month: a paid day off, to spend doing something you enjoy with others in the team, rest and recuperate, or a bit of both\n * A budget to spend at our merchants every month, as well as free deliveries through Packfleet, so you can support independent businesses and also get the Packfleet experience first hand\n * The equipment you need to work to your best, including a new Apple Silicon MacBook Pro",

      "description": "ClickMechanic is a marketplace for vehicle repairs. Our platform enables customers to acquire real-time industry-standard quotes for repairs (a first in Europe), services and diagnostics, and quickly book a vetted mechanic online. Our mission is to bring trust and transparency to car repair.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a unique opportunity to become an influential member of a small, remote engineering team. You will enjoy all of the benefits of working in a startup, the freedom to innovate, to explore new technologies and to use your experience and ideas to directly influence the business.\n\n\n\n\nThe Role\n\n\n\n\nAs a full-stack developer in a small, remote team, you will work across all aspects of the product from architecture and DevOps to code reviews and tech support. Working alongside our CTO & Head of Engineering, you will deliver new features and continually improve our existing code.\n\n\n\n\nTechnology underpins our entire business. We’ve built an industry-leading quote engine and mobile Mechanic App. We consume millions of rows of third-party automotive data and have implemented machine learning to improve the accuracy of our quotes.\n\n\n\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\n\n\n * Writing well-tested production code in Ruby and JavaScript\n * Refactoring and rearchitecting legacy code where appropriate to ensure you always leave it better than you found it\n * Reviewing code fairly and honestly; and receiving code reviews openly on each of your pull requests\n * Collaboration with business stakeholders to develop requirements and expectations\n * Collaboration with technical stakeholders to discuss constraints and opportunities\n * Monitoring our production systems and providing technical support to the business\n * Maintaining our development pipeline and toolchain\n * Innovation and self-led learning\n\n\n\n\nOur Technology\n\n\n\n\nAs a startup, we prefer open-source technologies. Our main application is built with Ruby (on Rails) and is hosted on Heroku and AWS. We mainly use PostgreSQL databases, but also use SQL Server and Elasticsearch. The application is mostly a “majestic monolith”, with a few components isolated as separate services or refactored out into private gems.\n\n\n\n\nOur mobile-optimised Mechanic App is built using React and Redux, with some parts of an older JQuery mobile implementation still remaining.\n\n\n\n\nOur development pipeline utilises Jira, Git, GitHub, Docker, Webpack, Grunt and CircleCI.\n\n\n\n\nWe also maintain an ELT pipeline using Meltano to import data into Snowflake for consumption via Looker.\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nYour success in this role\n\n\n\n\nYour potential is much more important to us than a list of characteristics. Nevertheless, here is a list of characteristics that we hope already apply to you, or that you’re very keen to develop:\n\n\n\n\n * You consider yourself fairly expert in at least one OO programming language (not necessarily Ruby)\n * You have built a production web application using an MVC (or equivalent) framework (e.g. Ruby on Rails)\n * Putting OOP, SOLID and TDD into practice makes make you feel warm inside\n * You have strong Git-fu experience and can perform interactive rebases from the command line\n * You’re not afraid to get stuck into DevOps\n * You write your best code when pair-programming with another developer regardless of their experience\n * You read about programming and technology because it’s a passion, not just a profession\n * You see legacy code as an exciting opportunity to innovate and make things better\n\n\n\n\nWhy ClickMechanic?\n\n\n\n\nFounded in 2012, the company has grown quickly to offer nationwide coverage and is backed by such institutional investors as 500 Startups and Forward Partners, and angel investors including the former CEO of JustEat and Chairman of Treatwell.\n\n\n\n\nVehicle repair is a huge market, ripe for technology disruption. There are millions of consumers, tera- or even peta-bytes of potentially underused data, with an exceptional logistics infrastructure (parts distribution).\n\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\n\n\n * Working with leading open-source technologies in an agile team\n * A culture that embraces flexibility, and rewards growth and innovation\n * The opportunity to directly contribute to the success of the business every day\n * A competitive package including company pension and share options\n * MacBook Pro as standard\n * 10% innovation time\n * Manage your own training budget\n * Full remote first working\n * 4 Hubble passes a month as standard (and more if you need them), enabling you to work from shared workspaces if you fancy a change\n * Bringing trust and transparency to an industry which is widely recognised for high levels of customer dissatisfaction\n\n\n\n\nPS: No recruiters please, direct applications only.",

Before I tell you more about the role, here's a little bit about Mention Me and what we do.\n\n\n\n\nBecoming a Mentioneer means you’ll be joining our Customer Advocacy Intelligence® movement, which is changing the world of marketing.\n\n\n\n\nOur data-driven Advocacy Intelligence Platform equips brands to drive growth through their fans by encouraging and rewarding personal recommendations.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a good chance you’ve already come across us while online shopping from Puma, Michael Kors, ASOS, Ray Ban, or any other of the 500+ brands we work with.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve delivered more than 5.5m referrals totalling over $2bn in revenue for our clients.\n\n\n\n\nNow, our mission to make all brands think advocacy-first is stepping up a gear, and you might be just who we need to help us.\n\n\n\n\nThe Role\n\n\n\n\nWe’re looking for an enthusiastic software engineer comfortable with PHP and keen to help figure out the solutions for how we make our product fantastic. Our challenges are not just rooted in code, but in the complexity of advocacy and how that maps to the goals of our clients.\n\n\n\n\nThis role will be primarily focused on our backend system (Symfony, PHP) but there will be opportunities to work across the platform including frontend (React, TypeScript), the APIs (GraphQL, REST), our integration tool of choice (Tray.io) and all the other tools and technologies that keep everything humming. You don't need to be an expert in everything - you'll be working with a talented team of engineers, each with their own strengths and expertise and we work together to support each other.\n\n\n\n\nWe empower engineers to work with other experts across the business to find the solutions that accelerate the value of advocacy for our clients. We do this through the INSPIRED product process where small, multi-disciplinary teams of product managers, designers and engineers build products that move us towards our vision.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to be involved in product and technology from the ground up in a small team that loves continuous improvement, this role would be perfect for you.\n\n\n\n\nWhat you’ll do:\n\n\n\n\n * On a typical day, you'll be working towards one of our company goals - for instance building new consumer APIs, creating a new marketing automation integration with one of our partners, working with different partners and learning about cutting edge marketing platforms or guiding our clients through the complexity of integrating advocacy into their marketing stack\n * You'll engage closely with product managers, designers, your engineering peers, alongside stakeholders from the wider business including our delightful client team. You'll be experimenting with our product, aiming to fail fast in product research and help us get through the cycle of testable to usable to loveable. You'll use your expertise in collaboration with your colleagues to build out our extensive library of integrations, using PHP to bring your (and your teams) ideas to life\n * You'll also take ownership with your peers of deploying code, measuring the effectiveness of your team's features and making informed choices with the data available to build improvements. We're delivering the product together - and we're all here to help each other through feedback, training and coaching too\n\n\n\n\nWe'd really like to hear from you, if...\n\n\n\n\n * You have 2-5 years experience with PHP in a commercial, agile software delivery, environment\n * You have the ability to work across our stack: JavaScript, React, TypeScript\n * You have a desire to put the user first - not the technology\n * You have good written and verbal skills - particularly with non-technical people regarding technical subjects\n * You have experience using git, GitHub and continuous integration (or equivalent technologies)\n\n\n\n\nBonus:\n\n\n\n\nWe'd love to see a candidate who can demonstrate experience in the following, but we do not consider them essential:\n\n\n\n\n * Building within a production-strength SaaS platform based on best practice architectures, providing high availability (last year we had 99.97% uptime)\n * Tray.io - we use this platform with many of our integrations\n * GraphQL, MySQL, and the AWS stack or other equivalent technologies\n * Working within a multi-disciplinary product team, and experience working closely with product managers and designers to define, measure and achieve product success\n * Designing with a security-first approach\n * Have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Maths or a related discipline\n\n\n\n\nWhat you’ll get:\n\n\n\n\nHere are some of our favourite perks and benefits, but we have so many more!\n\n\n\n\n🏡 Remote and Hybrid working.\n\n\n\n\n🏥 Private medical insurance with Vitality, including: mental wellbeing support, a range of lifestyle benefits and great incentives\n\n\n\n\n👩🏾‍⚕️ Major dental, vision, and life insurance policies.\n\n\n\n\n📚 An annual learning and development budget\n\n\n\n\n🤲🏾 2 Celebration Days: additional time off for you to celebrate religious days, cultural events, birthdays, anniversaries, or any other significant day that’s important to you\n\n\n\n\n👨‍👩‍👧 Enhanced parental leave\n\n\n\n\n🌴 25 days holiday plus public holidays, alongside additional days for being a Mentioneer\n\n\n\n\n🏆 Monthly prizes for being amazing! Values Awards and Customer Love awards, and Founders’ Award for Awesomeness. Win up to £500 cash, vouchers, meals out and trips away.\n\n\n\n\n🤩 Regular social events, from chocolate-tasting and pottery-making to poker nights and picnics\n\n\n\n\n💻 All the up-to-date tech you’ll need (we love Macs)\n\n\n\n\n🫶🏼 Short and long-term disability support\n\n\n\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion\n\n\n\n\nWe celebrate every Mentioneer, exactly as they are. We don’t shy away from breaking down systemic discrimination in society, or from difficult conversations and decisions. We’re committed to being a force for change. You can read more about how we’re doing this and always learning, by looking at our blogs here.\n\n\n\n\nThe same goes for our recruitment. We welcome every application, regardless of race, religion or belief, ethnic origin, physical ability, family structure, socioeconomic status, age, nationality or citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation or gender identity.

      "description": "We are looking for enthusiastic Software Developers to join the growing development team at LMAX Group and collaborate with us to solve interesting and challenging technical problems, developing high quality, low latency, performant software.\n\n\n\n\nYou won’t find a long list of hard requirements here. If you are a motivated and self-driven developer who will enjoy learning and growing together with us, then we’d love to talk to you.\n\n\n\n\nWhat you’ll work on\n\n\n\n\nThe LMAX Group dev team works across the whole of the business. To avoid accumulating knowledge silos, we actively rotate developers around our teams, ensuring that everyone gains first-hand knowledge on all areas of our codebase and gets to work on a wide variety of projects, such as:\n\n\n\n\n * Designing and building software for low latency trading systems\n * Investigating new block chain technologies\n * Analytics tools to help senior management make data-led business decisions\n * Improving our platform’s security and resilience\n\n\n\n\nOur tech stack\n\n\n\n\n * Backend: distributed, event-driven core Java (90% of the code base), MySQL\n * Frontend: Javascript, Vue.js\n * Data analytics: Python & Jupyter notebooks, Parquet, Docker\n * Blockchain integrations: Bitcoin (& Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash), Ethereum and XRP (Ripple)\n * Testing: JUnit, Mockito, JMH, JCStress, Jenkins, Selenium, many in-house tools…\n * OS: Linux (CentOS)\n\n\n\n\nDue to our strict performance requirements, some bits of our architecture aren’t entirely conventional... We don’t expect you to arrive with an in-depth knowledge of all of our stack - we’ll teach you that.\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nWhat you’ll bring\n\n\n\n\n * A good understanding of how to write clean, efficient, well tested code\n * A keenness to learn and to work in a highly collaborative environment\n * Strong communication and problem-solving skills\n * An appreciation that the simple solution to a problem - while often harder to discover than the complex one - is usually best\n\n\n\n\nOur Values\n\n\n\n\nWorking collaboratively: We work in a very social and collaborative environment, even while remote. Working as a team and with colleagues from across the business, allows multiple ideas to combine into stronger designs and better solutions. Pair programming ensures high quality code, supports knowledge growth and sharing of expertise. With many eyes contributing to any code before it goes into production, you will rarely find a traditional code review at LMAX Group.\n\n\n\n\nTest driven: LMAX Group relies heavily on test driven development and automation. We gain rapid feedback and confidence from 35,000 end-to-end tests running every half an hour. There are also extensive unit, compatibility, migration, and resilience tests.\n\n\n\n\nWe care a lot more about software performance than many other organisations. We have a range of continuous performance tests designed to catch any regression before it reaches production, from targeted microbenchmarks to end-to-end replays of production traffic.\n\n\n\n\nDedicated to quality: We care a lot about quality; we like to dig deep into the code-base and leave things better than we found them - more readable, better modelled, more performant, more consistent. There is a permanent expectation of delivering high quality, maintainable code, and minimising technical debt.\n\n\n\n\nYou won’t be stressed about deadlines and pressured to cut corners just to get things done quickly. As a team we enjoy building software and seeing that software used, and although we want to deliver things in a timely manner, we always strive to write things properly and cleanly the first time.\n\n\n\n\nAlways improving: We regularly examine our successes and failures to look at how we can improve both as a team and individually. Alongside regular internal training sessions, we have a generous budget supporting attendance at conferences or training courses and we set aside Friday afternoons as a time for developers to pursue an interest or learn something.\n\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\n\n\n * Smart, friendly colleagues keen to share their knowledge and learn new things from you\n * The opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects, including cutting edge technology, and interesting technical & performance challenges\n * A culture where high quality maintainable code is valued over quick hacks\n * Generous funding pot for training courses and conferences\n * Flexible working options, and home working support\n * Competitive salary\n * 25 days holiday (increasing to 30 with service), plus bank holidays\n * A benefits suite including ride to work & electric car schemes, private medical insurance, life insurance and critical illness cover, pension plan, gym membership & more\n * Relaxed dress-code\n * Think you know every IntelliJ shortcut? Think again. (yes, this is a benefit!)\n\n\n\n\nLMAX Group is an equal opportunity employer and actively seeks to ensure that we continue to attract applications from a diverse range of candidates to reflect the diversity that already exists across the organisation.",

It shouldn’t take a CS degree to build great data pipelines, and abstracting away the difficult parts is our mission.\n\n\n\n\nAre you ready for the challenge?\n\n\n\n\nWhat you are going to do: - Solve challenging engineering problems related to the performance and robustness of distributed systems infrastructure - Come up with novel ideas on how to make complex data technology user-friendly, and then turn those ideas into software - Be part of the team that builds the next generation of ETL/ELT infrastructure\n\n\n\n\nWhat we want to see in you: - You are drawn to and have experience solving challenging engineering problems - You build robust and scalable data systems three times as fast as other developers - Coding in Java is second nature to you - You’re living in or willing to work in London - You’re excited to work in a scrappy environment - You’re down to earth and fun to be around. This is an absolute must!\n\n\n\n\nBig plus if you have the following: - Experience working in a startup engineering team - Working knowledge of S3, EMR, Terraform, and Docker - Know the ins and outs of current big data frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, or Flink, but this is not an absolute requirement - you’re a quick learner!\n\n\n\n\n*** This role is open to individuals living in London.

      "description": "About Us\n\n\n\n\nInnovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.\n\n\n\n\nWe're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.\n\n\n\n\nBuilding software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.\n\n\n\n\nOur human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.\n\n\n\n\nLife at Builder\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint-hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less, and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEART (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.\n\n\n\n\nOur scale-up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together to savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWouldYouBuild\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nWe are looking for a Full Stack Developer to produce scalable software solutions. You’ll be part of a cross-functional team that’s responsible for the full software development life cycle, from conception to deployment.\n\n\n\n\nAs a Full Stack Developer, you should be comfortable around both front-end and back-end coding languages, development frameworks, and third-party libraries. You should also be a team player with a knack for visual design and utility.\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re also familiar with Agile methodologies, we’d like to meet you.\n\n\n\n\nWhy You Should Join\n\n\n\n\nIt is a challenging and diverse role that requires you to improve the existing developer platform, with a constant focus on making the experience better and more feature-packed. While trying to find solutions to problems, which are often overlooked or just too complicated for people to think about solving. Join this role if you are someone who doesn't shy away from creating a path in uncharted territory and is comfortable with trying, failing, and course-correcting fast.\n\n\n\n\nDeliverables\n\n\n\n\n * Write reusable, testable, and efficient code\n * Design and implement low-latency, reusable & performant applications\n * Implementation of security and data protection\n * Performance tuning, improvement, balancing, usability, automation\n * Collaborating with various stakeholders not exclusive to QA, DevOps, PMs, and other developers\n * Write technical documentation.\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\n * Proven experience as a Full Stack Developer or similar role\n * Experience developing desktop applications for Linux\n * 2+ years in working with Kubernetes/Docker-based Systems.\n * 2+ years’ experience of designing/deploying solutions on major cloud providers (AWS/Azure)\n * Knowledge of multiple front-end languages and libraries (e.g. HTML/ CSS, JavaScript, jQuery)\n * Knowledge of multiple back-end languages (e.g., Python, Ruby, Java) and JavaScript frameworks (e.g., Angular, React)\n * Familiarity with databases (e.g., PostgreSQL), web servers (e.g. Apache, Nginx) and UI/UX design\n * Working knowledge of standard CS fundamentals (data structures, algorithms, complexity analysis)\n\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\n\n\n * Health and wellness benefits\n * Performance-based bonuses and stock options\n * Employee friendly policies\n * Generous vacation and time off benefits, including paid holidays\n * Generally flexible working hour.",

We build software to automate the carbon footprinting of supply chains. Banks, traders, and manufacturers use our product to tame the complexity of international supply networks, identify the most carbon-intensive parts, and find greener alternatives. Having developed technology which is significant in advance of competitive solutions, we are now investing heavily in market adoption.\n\n\n\n\nYou can find out more about interviewing at CarbonChain at https://www.carbonchain.com/careers/interview-process .\n\n\n\n\nTo join Carbon Chain, you’ll be a keen technologist who loves to learn from others. Our company is made up of passionate people with expertise ranging from oil refining to deep learning. Between us we’ve run Amazon’s European supply chain, built JustEat’s corporate meal delivery platform, and monitored industrial emissions with satellites for Al Gore. We’ve got MBAs and PhDs but we know that there’s a lot we don’t know, and we’re hoping you can help fill that gap.\n\n\n\n\nWhat will you be responsible for at Carbon Chain?\n\n\n\n\nWe are at the start of our journey and want to build the right things, the right way. We are cloud-first, allowing us to scale at will and experiment with adding new services quickly. As a Software Engineer you’ll play a key role within the company, taking responsibility for your team’s services and the tech that powers them. You’ll take pride in developing your team and its relationship with the wider business, getting involved in the end-to-end delivery process and owning projects of varying sizes.\n\n\n\n\nYou can expect to have:\n\n\n\n\n * Ownership of your projects\n * An independent path to production\n * The ability to make real changes with tangible business value\n\n\n\n\nThe core of the system relies on a handful of services built in Python Fast API and Java Spring Boot. We aren’t shy to add other tools that make us ship valuable features better and faster. Other tools comprise Angular/Typescript, PostgreSQL, Redis, Cognito, but our cloud-based infrastructure enables us to explore new technologies parallel with our existing platform. We’d love to bring on engineers who come from diverse backgrounds to help us explore new angles of solving business challenges and deliver solutions that wow our customers.\n\n\n\n\nWe are particularly interested in strong Java and Python developers (ideally with exposure to Spring-like frameworks), front-end developers who are passionate about modern JavaScript frameworks (preferably Angular), or people from any modern Web development stack environment.\n\n\n\n\nOur only must-haves are possessing a hunger to solve business challenges using technology and the ability to build close relationships with your team.\n\n\n\n\nWhich tools, technologies, and processes will you work with?\n\n\n\n\n * Containerised applications are the key to our technology vision allowing us to replicate production environments locally and scale services at will.\n * Object-oriented code forms the bulk of our codebase.\n * PostgreSQL and DynamoDB managed databases form the persistence layer - you’ll learn to navigate document and relational databases and appreciate the values in both worlds.\n * Infrastructure automation is owned by the whole team, helping to spread the DevOps mentality across the whole technology department (and beyond).\n * Testing approaches from unit testing to integration testing are key to delivering reliable and maintainable solutions.\n * Quality assurance is owned by the team themselves - we believe that full cycle product ownership should sit tightly within the team.\n * Agile development, using various approaches from Scrum to Elephant Carpaccio , helps us deliver software in small iterations, learning and course-correcting in the process to make sure we deliver the right improvements.\n * GitHub PRs are an integral part of our core development flow - with reviews to help share knowledge and improve quality.\n * Continuous delivery is the approach we strive for - with metrics that help us optimise parts of the pipeline that need it the most.\n * Teamwork and collaboration are fundamental to the delivery of our solutions. We encourage solutionizing between the team and the wider business.\n\n\n\n\nYou don’t need to be a pro at all of these skills to apply for the role, but we’d love to hear about any relevant knowledge and experiences that you have in these areas.\n\n\n\n\nWhat We’re Offering\n\n\n\n\n * Competitive salary + generous equity package\n * Flexible working hours - we encourage regular breaks and being AFK (away from keyboard) to support your wellbeing\n * Flexible working location (we like to meet in the office couple of times every week)\n * £2000 annual development allowance for you to spend on developing your current skills and learning new things\n * Dev equipment of your choice\n * Regular social activities\n * Generous amount of holidays\n\n\n\n\nIf you think your skills and experience match what we’re looking for and you’d like to join a Carbon Tech industry unicorn, please get in touch!",
