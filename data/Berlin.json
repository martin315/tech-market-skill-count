We are at the exciting stage where the growth of our company forces us to do aggressive hirings to realize our visions quicker.\n\n\n\n\nWe automate the processing of images, audio, video, and text using AI so people can be more human. Our Unified AI Platform for unstructured data processing has been adopted by leading insurance, financial services, retail, technology, agriculture, and testing, inspection, and certification (TIC) services companies. We strive to democratize access to artificial intelligence and use AI to enrich the human experience.\n\n\n\n\nYour profile\n\n\n\n\nWhat you'll do:\n\n\n\n\n * Design/implement a system orchestrating machine learning workflows\n * Build SDKs to enable engineers using our platform easily\n * Build tools to enable our AI engineers be efficient in developing new AI solutions\n   \n\n\n\n\nWhat we are looking for:\n\n\n * Smart, humble, hardworking, and collaborative\n    * By smart we don't necessarily mean high IQ (although a huge plus), but an affinity toward learning. We want to automate as much as possible so we can focus on the few things that require human intelligence and creativity.\n    * By humble we don't mean submissive or unambitious, we mean it in the same way Roger Federer is humble.\n    * By hardworking, we don't mean long hours (be with your family). What we mean is while you're here you're doing the best work of your life. It means being disciplined, professional, focused, gritty, resilient, and resourceful.\n    * By collaborative, we don't mean submissive or deferential, it means taking leadership from everywhere. \"I'm taking responsibility to fix this system\", if there's a lack of trust \"I'm going to address it\", if goals are unclear \"I'm going to deal with it\", it's about being a meritocracy\n    * All four of the above are required. We all know people missing one of these and it's not nice to work with them (e.g. someone who is smart and hardworking but not humble and collaborative).\n      \n\n * Paradoxical\n    * The people we like the most are smart but humble\n    * Wants to win no matter what, but will not cross lines of integrity to get there\n    * Strong beliefs weakly held, etc.\n    * 3+ years of software engineering experience\n    * Solid foundational knowledge of Java, Python, React/Angular\n    * Familiarity with distributed system and cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP) is a plus\n      \n      \n      \n\n   If this resonates with you, it would be amazing to get to know each other- reach out and send an application!\n   \n   \n   \n   \n    * We believe AI is going to be the most impactful technology ever invented. It may be the last technology we ever needed to invent as humans. We don‚Äôt want it to be in the hands of the few, but the hands of the many. Our technology promises to transform the way AI is created and consumed to make this vision possible.\n    * We are searching for the best-of-the-best to build a massive company, but at the same time a company where people are happy with their lives, feel healthy, passionate and satisfied.\n    * We're 30 people and have just launched, so you will have the opportunity to shape things from the beginning and see the company grow\n    * Although super.AI is young, this is not our first rodeo: our CEO previously founded a few hundred person company, and between us we've held senior positions at Google, Amazon, Adobe, Microsoft, McKinsey\n      ",

We help companies get and stay compliant with standards such as ISO 27001, GDPR, TISAX, and SOC 2 in weeks rather than months.\n\nOur platform integrates with a company‚Äôs tech stack (such as GCP, AWS, Azure, Google Workspaces, Jira, Gitlab, etc.), automatically extracts the data needed for compliance, and creates a checklist to become and remain certified. Our fastest customer finished their certification in 4 weeks instead of 12+ months, typically seen from older institutions.\n\nWe raised pre-seed funding from top German angel investors and recently closed our seed round from leading UK and German VCs after impressive growth. Now, the goal (with your help) is to become the market leader.\n\nAbout the role:\n\nAs a small team, we are all generalists and constantly picking up new challenges. Regarding product and code, we‚Äôre looking to work with experienced people who can pick a problem and solve it. We use TypeScript and want to build more scalable systems so we can continuously make progress on a solid foundation. We don‚Äôt expect you to have a background in everything we use but expect strong JavaScript fundamentals and a background working with Angular and TypeScript. Every feature that is being ideated will go through you, and every future front-end engineer hire will live the engineering values that you will shape with us and live by. You'll get first-hand exposure to what it means to build and scale a remote software startup.\n\nPreferred experience & culture:\n\n * You love iterating and taking pride in owning customer-facing features from ideas to going live and strive for great visuals and usability.\n * You are a team player and communicate with other members and set up calls with customers if necessary to get feedback directly.\n * You have strong JavaScript fundamentals working with Angular and TypeScript with more than 7 years of experience in front-end development.

Priorities can change fast. Hence you are a strong believer that hard work and flexibility are qualities that an early startup employee should live by. You can pick up a customer problem, define it, and work on it.\n * You love speed and have high standards in writing clean, maintainable, and testable code.\n * You have 3+ years of experience in a fast-paced tech environment, startup, or scale-up where engineers wear multiple hats and define the products together with users.\n * You are a force multiplier for your team. You always catch up with new front-end trends, love building reusable components, and helping other engineers become better day by day.\n * You can communicate and structure your thoughts well both inside and outside of your team to ensure we ship products in time without getting lost in details.\n * You have experience in mentoring junior developers or leading a small team.\n * You have experience in working and improving a remote team culture.\n   \n   \n\nResponsibilities\n\n * You‚Äôll design, develop, and maintain new user-facing features with beautiful and scalable UI components using Angular and TypeScript\n * You‚Äôll contribute to new and existing products by shaping features with product and design teams.\n * You‚Äôll implement state management and improved authentication across the platform\n * You‚Äôll implement complex Angular components from drag & drop to the virtualized rendering of large data collections\n * You‚Äôll mentor and develop junior engineers to help them become expert Secfixers\n * You‚Äôll keep learning new technologies to improve our product and will structure complex product in simple deliverables\n * You‚Äôll redefine best-in-class software development processes so that we can build an opinionated product for the European SMB market.\n * You‚Äôll work closely with founders, tech lead, other team members, and users to ship features on schedule.\n   \n   \n\nOur Tech\n\n * Angular frontend with styled-components & TypeScript\n * Ngrx State management\n * Java Springboot, Node Nest.js, Postgres, and RDS as backend\n * Hosted on AWS with ECS, EKS\n * Gitlab, Slack, Notion, Gather.town for communication and documentation\n * Clickup for project management\n * Design system with Bootstrap Angular component library\n   \n   \n\nWe are very proud of our Secfix values - and look for candidates who share them.

We love working by YCombinator's principles and preach those to our team.\n * We create trust within our organisation. Transparency and ethics are within our DNA.\n * We are hacky.

Building a startup is about ownership and being accountable for timely delivery.\n * We are leaders of remote work. We are passionately building a culture where people can be productive working from anywhere.\n   \n   \n\nBenefits you get at Secfix:\n\n * We are backed by top VCs and accelerators.
