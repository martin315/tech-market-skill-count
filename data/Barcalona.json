    "description": "A Little Bit About Flanks\n\n\n\n\nFlanks is a Barcelona-based fintech company focused on wealth management services. Its main product is a SaaS solution that helps financial advisors, family offices, private banks and other institutions to have a holistic view of their clients’ financial assets while using the latest scraping technology. We’re currently building the benchmark in the Open Wealth industry, and so far, we managed to have compatibility with over 280 custodian entities.\n\n\n\n\nThanks to our clients, we continue to grow at a fast pace. We have multiplied our growth by six, built a presence in 11 different countries in the last 18 months. In August 2021, Flanks raised €2.3 million in an investment round led by JME Ventures and SeedRocket 4Founders Capital to accelerate our market expansion.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to accelerate our market expansion in Europe and Americas, we would like to count on you to also grow (personally and professionally) with us.\n\n\n\n\nFlanks’s Values Are\n\n\n\n\n * People first: To us, the most important thing is for “Flankers” to feel at ease, for them to get involved in a project and feel part of the team.\n * Keep growing: Our team believes that people growing in lockstep with the company is essential, both personally and professionally.\n * Think twice, act once: We like to think about all the possible consequences for taking any decision that could affect the team or our clients.\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re looking to grow professionally in a very fast-growing company with an exciting start-up culture, this is your opportunity!\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Role\n\n\n\n\nYou'll be working as a full member of the Solutions Team, participating in the design, planning and execution of new features and the maintenance of the current ones. The team is responsible for most of our customer facing and internal products.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a generalist role. This does not mean we expect you to know absolutely everything. You will have your areas of expertise and things you’ll like more than others. However, you will be exposed (and sometimes deeply working) on all layers of the stack: from the front-end to our APIs, databases and even infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\nYou will be expected to lead small initiatives on your own and to sustain a high level of quality in your work. Support and training will be provided, but you should have learning skills and the ability to do research on your own.\n\n\n\n\nThis is not a full-remote position. Although most of the time you will be able to work from whenever you want, it is expected to come to the office by your own means a few times a month.\n\n\n\n\nThings we'd love to see on you\n\n\n\n\n * A few years of programming experience, preferably in Python or Javascript.\n * You have worked on projects with other people and have experience with Git.\n * Likewise, you are a team player and a good communicator. You focus on communication over resolution.\n * Experience working with databases, both SQL and NoSQL.\n * Working English and Spanish proficiency.\n * In general, the more experience with parts of our stack, the better. However, we're looking for the fundamentals, so don't worry if you don't tick all the boxes.\n * You are a nice person. Toxic behavior and bigotry will not be tolerated.\n\n\n\n\nOur current tech stack\n\n\n\n\n * Python on our back-end, migrating to async-based for most parts.\n * Vue in our front-end.\n * Running on GKE\n * Powered by MongoDB and PostgreSQL\n * Also, Redis, RabbitMQ, Jenkins, GitHub and other usual suspects.\n\n\n\n\nWhat We Can Offer\n\n\n\n\nA non-exhaustive list of perks includes:\n\n\n\n\n🏠 Office at 5 minutes from Pl. Espanya and Sants Estació\n\n\n\n\n🔆 Flexible working hours,\n\n\n\n\n🎊 Paid time off on your birthday\n\n\n\n\n🍒 Fresh fruit every week, all-you-can-drink tea and coffee\n\n\n\n\n🍻 Friday happy hours after our monthly team meetings (optional)\n\n\n\n\n😎 Team building events (optional)\n\n\n\n\n🙀 Personal holidays swap inside the same month\n\n\n\n\n🏥 Health insurance\n\n\n\n\n💸 Flexible remuneration with Cobee\n\n\n\n\n📚 Yearly training budget\n\n\n\n\nThe hiring process\n\n\n\n\n * You send us your resume, cover letter, etc.\n * A chat with the team manager, where we’ll dive deeper into your background, your possible fit, and where you’ll have the opportunity to ask any sort of questions.\n * A coding test, to take at home at your own time and with your own setup and tools. We will be flexible here, and if you already have some code suitable for discussion, we can use it.\n * A technical interview, including a review of the code assignment. No whiteboard or tricky algorithm questions: just a chat to sample the breadth and depth of your knowledge.\n * A meeting with our direction team (CTO and/or CEO).\n * Optionally, any other meeting you or us might need to clarify any pending questions.\n * We send you an offer.\n\n\n\n\nIf you think you meet most of the criteria described above, don’t hesitate to send us your CV and/or cover letter. We will be happy to hear from you!\n\n\n\n\nFlanks is deeply committed to diversity, equity and inclusion both in our hiring practices and in our experiences as a Flanks employee. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer, and encourage all applicants regardless of race, religion, or belief (if any), nationality, ethnic or national origin, gender, gender identity, pregnancy and maternity, sexual orientation, age, marital and civil partnership status, or disability status.",

PMQ is part of the Quality & Regulatory global function.\n\n\n\n\nThis internship will give you an opportunity to work in a small community (4 - 7 members) developing internal technical solutions for a global organization. As a member of the PMQ Solutions team, you will be working in a very transversal environment having the opportunity to work with different technologies such as JavaScript, Google Cloud Platform, Tableau, or APIs. Your main role will be software developer, and during the internship, you will be able to play, learn from different roles depending on your interest and team needs (Software Requirements, Architect, Tester, or even Product Owner) and contribute with your own ideas and proposals. You will work in an Agile environment in a team continuously improving.\n\n\n\n\nHow would your day-to-day look like?\n\n\n\n\nA day in your life as a SW intern will start with a daily meeting together with the rest of the team. We do follow agile methodologies and that daily meeting is key in terms of team alignment. It helps the members of the team to continue working on their respective tasks in perfect sync. The team works on different projects simultaneously. You will be assigned a collection of taks to work on depending on the stage of the different projects, the sprint goals and your current responsibilities at the time. Usually, the tasks you will be working on will be defined by tasks/user stories/items available on a JIRA board. You might be involved in some activities such as coding, testing, requirement gathering, documentation, and architecture design, ... Since this is a small and quite new team, the tasks you’ll have to work on will be very diverse, giving you the opportunity to wear different hats, experience and learn about the different roles involved in SW development.\n\n\n\n\nWho are you?\n\n\n\n\n * Recent graduate (max 2 years after graduation) in the fields of Informatics, Telecommunications, or Computer Science\n * Team player with the willingness to learn SW development, passionate about coding and IT\n * Some knowledge (could be academic) of web-based programming and technologies (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) and some cloud programming like GCP (Google Cloud Platform) services (firebase, google scripts, …)\n * Awareness of object-oriented design principles and algorithms\n * Strong communication skills in English (written and spoken) are essential\n\n\n\n\nWhat do we offer?\n\n\n\n\n * Being part of a diverse and growing team that falls within an impactful global organization, such as it is the case of Post Market Quality\n * Having the opportunity to apply the skills you gained throughout your education\n * Getting hands-on experience developing Software Solutions\n * Huge investment in coding training\n * Learning from very experienced members who will be able to guide you and help with your personal development\n * Working in an international environment, letting you improve your communication skills in English\n\n\n\n\nWhy our team?\n\n\n\n\nThe Post Market Quality team is the global team under the Quality and Regulatory organization that ensures end-to-end solutions for all on-market Product Quality and Product Performance related questions. Those solutions enable accountability for Complaint Handling, Vigilance Reporting, Global Safety Board & Recall Management, and overall Post-Market Surveillance for Diagnostics.\n\n\n\n\nPMQ is a DIVERSE group of 26+ nationalities with more than 20+ spoken languages. Our priority is to provide a quick resolution to our patients and customers' issues.\n\n\n\n\nThe PMQ Solutions team is developing exploratory solutions that allow PMQ users to improve their experience on their day-to-day.\n\n\n\n\nWho we are\n\n\n\n\nAt Roche, more than 100,000 people across 100 countries are pushing back the frontiers of healthcare. Working together, we’ve become one of the world’s leading research-focused healthcare groups. Our success is built on innovation, curiosity and diversity.\n\n\n\n\nRoche is an Equal Opportunity Employer.",

    "description": "A Little Bit About Flanks\n\n\n\n\nFlanks is a Barcelona-based fintech company focused on wealth management services. Its main product is a SaaS solution that helps financial advisors, family offices and other institutions to have a holistic view of their clients’ financial assets while using the latest scraping technology. We’re currently building the benchmark in the OpenWealth industry, and so far we managed to have compatibility with over 250 national and international entities.\n\n\n\n\nThanks to our clients, we continue to grow at a fast pace. We have already more than 300,000 aggregated portfolios spread across nearly 250 entities and have positioned our business at break-even in less than a year. In August 2021, Flanks raised €2.3 million in an investment round led by JME Ventures and SeedRocket 4Founders Capital.\n\n\n\n\nWe are pioneers in our market in Spain, which will certainly grow a lot in the next few months and years. However, we are going to take a league leap in terms of the volumetry of the system, as our key focus now is to accelerate our market expansion in Europe and LatAm. And we would like to count on you to also grow (personally and professionally) with us.\n\n\n\n\nFlanks’s Values Are\n\n\n\n\n * People first: To us, the most important thing is for “Flankers” to feel at ease, for them to get involved in a project and be feel part of the team.\n * Keep growing: Our team believes that people growing in lockstep with the company is essential, both personally and professionally.\n * Think twice, act once: We like to think about all the possible consequences before taking any decision that could affect the team or our clients.\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re looking to grow professionally, you’re passionate about understanding how things work, finance and helping and learning from others. This is your opportunity!\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Role\n\n\n\n\nYou will be a Backend Developer in our company. You'll be working as a full member of the Drivers team, participating in the process of data extraction from various custodian entities. You will be working with Python as a basis and custom techniques and methodologies in order to make data extraction and processing at large scale. You will cooperate with technical and financial people in order to understand in detail what you’re processing.\n\n\n\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\n\n\nExamples of tasks you can expect to work on are:\n\n\n\n\n * Understand and automate the login process of financial institutions websites with multi factor authentication mechanisms\n * Reverse engineering of online banking websites\n * All of the steps of an ETL data pipeline\n * Data extraction from websites content, csv and pdf documents\n\n\n\n\nOur tech stack\n\n\n\n\n * Python as code base\n * Browser emulation tools\n * Pandas for document data parsing\n * Jenkins as CI/CD\n * MongoDB as data storage tool\n\n\n\n\nThings we'd love to see on you\n\n\n\n\n * You are a nice person: Assholes and bigotry won’t be tolerated.\n * You live in Barcelona City and/or close enough to work at the office twice/three times a week. Living in Spain is a mandatory requirement, and a non-negotiable requirement.\n * Likewise, we can’t offer a relocation package and/or working visa.\n * You have working English and Spanish proficiency.\n * You have some experience in similar roles. We're looking for someone with some lessons already learned.\n * Working experience with data pipelines and scrapping.\n * You are familiar with MongoDB.\n * Meaningful experience with Javascript will be a huge plus.\n * We will be helping you to grow, so don't worry if you don't check all the boxes!\n\n\n\n\nWhat Can We Offer\n\n\n\n\nWe offer what we think is fair compensation (from 23K to 30K € per year for this role). We're on top of the market, but our intention is to increase compensation as the company grows. You will not be left behind. We believe this is a really nice time to join the project. This is a full-time, permanent contract.\n\n\n\n\nA Non-exhaustive List Of Perks Includes\n\n\n\n\n🏠 Office between Sants Estació and Plaça Espanya, with a 280 degree view of Barcelona.\n\n\n\n\n🔆 Flexible working hours\n\n\n\n\n🎊 Paid time off on your birthday\n\n\n\n\n🍒 Fresh fruit every week, all-you-can-drink tea and coffee\n\n\n\n\n🍻 Friday happy hours after our weekly team meetings (optional)\n\n\n\n\n😎 Team building events (optional)\n\n\n\n\n🙀 Personal holidays swap inside the same month\n\n\n\n\n🏥 Health insurance\n\n\n\n\n💸 Flexible remuneration with Cobee\n\n\n\n\n📚 Yearly training budget\n\n\n\n\nThe hiring process\n\n\n\n\nThis Is How The Usual Hiring Process Looks Like\n\n\n\n\n * You send us your resume, cover letter, etc.\n * A chat with our CTO Sergi Lao, where we’ll dive deeper into your background, your possible fit, and where you’ll have the opportunity to ask any sort of questions.\n * We will send you a technical test so we can see how you deal with problems and how you manage Python.\n * A meeting with our CTO and our CEO Joaquim de la Cruz.\n * Optionally, any other meeting you or us might need to clarify any pending questions.\n * We send you an offer.\n\n\n\n\nWe expect a few days to pass between each step. We aim for a process as short as one week and never longer than one month.\n\n\n\n\nIf you think you meet most of the criteria described above, don’t hesitate to send us your CV and/or cover letter. We will be happy to hear from you!\n\n\n\n\nFlanks is deeply committed to diversity, equity and inclusion both in our hiring practices and in our experiences as a Flanks employee. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer, and encourage all applicants regardless of race, religion, or belief (if any), nationality, ethnic or national origin, gender, gender identity, pregnancy and maternity, sexual orientation, age, marital and civil partnership status, or disability status.",

It remains founder-led – and has striven to maintain the ethos and drive that led them to grow organically year-on-year for the past 30 years. Starting in an NYU dorm room in the early 1990s, TransPerfect is today recognized as the largest translation and language services company in the world with thousands of employees located in 90+ offices around the world – and has exceeded $1 billion in revenue in 2021.\n\n\n\n\nThe TransPerfect TechOps team has been a vital part of the company’s success since its formation 10 years ago – delivering technology and services that have drastically simplified the lives of our clients and colleagues – from workflow improvements for colleagues to core services that form the basis of the company’s GlobalLink platform, to creating scalable client interfaces that allow novice users to navigate complex ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\nYour responsibilities and tasks will include:\n\n * Code defined features, investigate and fix bugs.\n * Write Unit Tests.\n * Participate in Code Reviews.\n * Take ownership and drive end-to-end quality software development processes.\n * Ability to code following different architectural design patterns.\n * Have knowledge of multiple areas or domains of the code/product.\n * Show a constant interest in learning new things and try proof of concepts to improve the code/product.\n * Be a mentor for other engineers.\n * Actively participate in frequent code/design/architecture reviews.\n\n\n\n\nThe minimum we’re looking for (show us what you got if you aren’t a perfect fit):\n\n * 1-3 years of software development experience.\n * Proficiency in JavaScript.\n * Strong experience using VueJs ecosystem.\n * Ability to take complex designs from Figma and make the corresponding HTML/CSS/JS code.\n * Experience/knowledge of Agile methodologies like SCRUM/Kanban.\n * Knowledge of SOLID principles.\n * Knowledge of clean code practices.\n * Ability to work with complex enterprise software architectures.\n\n\n\n\nWhy you should join us?

Today, most of the global team is on a hybrid model ranging between 3-4 days in the office per week. We aim to find an inclusive balance between everyone's personal lives and responsibilities and the value created from in-office collaboration. We work with new team members to find that balance with them while building the trust and collaboration that our team values.\n\nWe believe that sharing the same physical space with our colleagues creates a level of trust and understanding that fosters innovation and a sense of purpose.\n\nThe socializing and relationships formed from these in-person interactions have created the bonds that make our team successful.\n\nWe not only want to encourage people to safely spend time in the office, but also, schedule regular travel between our offices in Europe and the US – and a regular conference where the entire worldwide team is gathered together. Maybe the Metaverse will replace the office some day – but it hasn't yet! Online meetings were a powerful connector during the pandemic – but they don't foster the same connection.",
